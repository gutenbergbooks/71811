    Transcriber’s Notes</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The cover image was provided by the transcriber and is placed in the public domain.</p>
  <p>
    Punctuation has been standardized.</p>
  <p>
    Most of the non-common abbreviations used to save space in printing have been expanded to the non-abbreviated form for easier reading.</p>
  <p class="x-ebookmaker-drop">
    Most abbreviations have been expanded in tool-tips for screen-readers and may be seen by hovering the mouse over the abbreviation.</p>
  <p>
    This book was written in a period when many words had not become standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been left unchanged unless indicated with a Transcriber’s Note.</p>
  <p>
    Index references have not been checked for accuracy.</p>
  <p>
    The symbol ‘‡’ indicates the description in parenthesis has been added to an illustration. This may be needed if there is no caption or if the caption does not describe the image adequately.</p>
  <p>
    Footnotes are identified in the text with a superscript number and are shown immediately below the paragraph in which they appear.</p>

    PREFACE<br>
    <small>BY THE</small><br>
    GENERAL EDITOR FOR THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
  <p class="chaphdbrk txt_lg">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> present General Editor for the Old Testament in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges desires to say that, in accordance with the policy of his predecessor the Bishop of Worcester, he does not hold himself responsible for the particular interpretations adopted or for the opinions expressed by the editors of the several Books, nor has he endeavoured to bring them into agreement with one another. It is inevitable that there should be differences of opinion in regard to many questions of criticism and interpretation, and it seems best that these differences should find free expression in different volumes. He has endeavoured to secure, as far as possible, that the general scope and character of the series should be observed, and that views which have a reasonable claim to consideration should not be ignored, but he has felt it best that the final responsibility should, in general, rest with the individual contributors.</p>

    § 1: <span class="smcap">
      Characteristics of Ancient Historical Writings</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Until recent times the study of the historical records of Israel and of other nations of antiquity has suffered from insufficient recognition of the principles and procedure of ancient historians. It is obvious that a great contrast exists between any modern historical work and those books of the Old Testament which relate the fortunes of Israel; and unless there is a clear perception of the main facts to which this contrast is due, the nature and value of the Books of Chronicles cannot readily be understood and certainly will not be properly appreciated. It is desirable therefore to deal with this matter at the outset, before proceeding to consider the special characteristics of Chronicles.</p>
  <p>
    (1) <i>Standpoint.</i> According to the modern point of view, a perfect history would seem to be a complete and impartial statement of events. This ideal is unattainable, for even the fullest account must fall far short of the richness of actual life. Moreover, it is imperative that the trivial be distinguished from the important, and the facts be presented according to their relative values. A historian is therefore necessary to arrange the material so that the events are seen in their proper relationship. Thereby, however, a subjective element is introduced into our histories. Life is so complex that two men considering the same facts may reach very different conclusions concerning them. We cannot wholly escape this danger, but we do claim
    <a id="a010"></a>that the historian shall consciously seek to present the truth and nothing but the truth. He must not deliberately suppress or distort facts to favour (say) the Protestant or the Roman Catholic view of the Reformation. A modern historian may be convinced that sin leads to disaster, but he must not therefore write that a certain wicked monarch perished dethroned and in misery, if he knows that he died peacefully in his royal bed. If he wishes to enforce the doctrine that “the wages of sin is death,” either he may turn to history and select incidents which support that view, or he may invent characters and weave them into a tale which points his moral, or he may discuss the belief generally; but he ought not to publish as serious history a work in which, irrespective of facts, every wicked king is punished or involves his land in ruin. We should count such a work an illegitimate use of historical material, unless the author gave some clear indication of its real nature. We draw a sharp distinction between history and fiction, and in the serious historian we demand fidelity to the truth as he sees it.</p>
  <p>
    This modern standpoint is in reality the outcome of that more scientific habit of mind which insists above all things on accurate observation of phenomena and on the subordination of theory to fact. But the duty of scientific thinking has not so very long been recognised by the human mind, and in former days many things were legitimate and natural which would not be so now. The moment we make allowance for our mental environment, we can conceive that there might be other ideas than our own as to what constitutes the use and abuse of historical records. To us the facts are primary, and the lessons they seem to teach must be accepted, whether they suit our wishes or not. But an ancient writer was not dominated by that maxim. Supposing he desired to teach that “Virtue is rewarded,” he <i>might</i> consider that an excellent way of enforcing his theory was not only to use the narratives of the past, but to mould and modify them as best suited his object. History might be made the tool of his conviction, and the tool be shaped to assist his purpose. If it is hard for us to realise
    <a id="a011"></a>that such a procedure was legitimate <i>for him</i>, that is simply due to the difficulty we have in being anything except the children of our own age.</p>
  <p>
    The earliest historical records of Israel were not attempts to write a continuous history of the people, but popular tales and songs commemorating such deeds of the people or its heroes as had made a profound impression on the popular imagination. An excellent example is the famous Song of Deborah in Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr>
    Records of this type were long transmitted orally, but eventually were gathered together into written collections, such as the Book of Jashar, referred to by the canonical writers (see Joshua <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 13, 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 18).
    As national history lengthened out and State records accumulated in connection with palace and temple, the idea would finally arise of combining these with the popular memories so as to form a connected historical narrative. But the motive which prompted the formation of such accounts was not scientific interest nor even perhaps curiosity to ascertain the exact course of events, but the desire to interest, to instruct, and above all to edify contemporary thought and life. Broadly, we may distinguish two types of ancient historical writing; first, the <i>descriptive</i> narrative in which events were recorded on account of their intense human interest, and, secondly, the <i>didactic</i>, where the older descriptive tales and any other available material were selected, related, and built into a unity in such fashion as might best serve to bring out the religious, moral, or political lessons which they seem to teach or which the writer was anxious to impress upon his generation. The books of Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
    and of Chronicles both belong to the didactic type<a
      id="a011a" href="#n_1" class="anchor">¹</a>.
    Thus, they contain many stories (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    the <i>details</i> of Jehu’s revolution in Kings) which teach no special lesson but are recorded for their
    <a id="a012"></a>intrinsic interest; and also much annalistic record of fact. But this material has been welded together by a writer or writers who were supremely interested in the religious condition of their people, who believed that the character and purpose of God were manifest in the vicissitudes of their national history, and who desired to make the ethical and spiritual import of that history clear to their fellow-men. Hence in their present form their works are not scientific records but rather what may be termed “history with a motive.” For instance, the space given to the tales about Elisha the prophet compared with the brief allusion to Omri King of Israel is entirely disproportionate to their respective values in the <i>political</i> sphere. The books of Samuel and Kings are practical and powerful appeals to history in the interests of religious faith. The same is true of Chronicles, and to an even greater degree, because Chronicles belongs to a later period than Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings (see <a
      href="#a017a">§ 3</a>),
    when the religious convictions of Israel were felt with extraordinary intensity, and could be expressed in accordance with certain precise theological beliefs.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_1">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a011a">¹</a> That <i>both</i> Samuel<abbr
          title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
        and Chronicles can be classed as didactic does not imply that they do not differ greatly in character: the former books are “prophetic” and national, relating God’s dealings with the nation as a whole, whilst Chronicles gives an essentially priestly and ecclesiastical view of the history.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    (2) <i>Method: the treatment of “sources.”</i> It is of no less importance to realise something of the difference of method between ancient and modern historians, particularly as regards their treatment of “sources.”</p>
  <p>
    For all that lies beyond his personal experience the historian is, of course, dependent on sources, documentary or otherwise. The modern writer recognises the duty of testing and verifying the accuracy of the sources he uses for his narrative, and in producing his own account of affairs he is expected, where desirable, to state the sources upon which he has relied. The ancient historian also made use of sources, but (1) he used them uncritically, with little or no anxiety concerning their accuracy, and (2) it was his custom simply to select from the available material any passages, long or short, even words or phrases, which served his purpose, and to incorporate these in his work, frequently without any indication of the borrowing. Only in certain instances was the source precisely referred to. Moreover
    <a id="a013"></a>(3) the utmost freedom was exercised in dealing with the passages thus chosen. Sometimes they were reproduced word for word; at other times they were partially or wholly transformed to suit the new context. This may seem an unwarrantable procedure to us, but one has only to examine the actual instances of these adaptations or transformations of unnamed sources to perceive that the ancient<a
      id="a013a" href="#n_2" class="anchor">¹</a>
    writer has acted in perfect good faith, with no suspicion that the manipulation was in any way blameworthy. How indeed could it have been otherwise? The science of literary criticism was unknown, “notions of literary propriety and plagiarism had not been thought of, and writers who advanced no pretensions to originality for themselves were guilty of no imposture when they borrowed without acknowledgement from their predecessors” (Skinner, <i>Kings</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 7).</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_2">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a013a">¹</a> Nor need one go back to antiquity for an instance. Most instructive examples of composite narrative compiled uncritically but quite innocently by mediaeval chroniclers from earlier sources may be found in Chapman’s <i>Introduction to the Pentateuch</i> (in this series), <abbr
          title="pages">pp.</abbr> 260 <abbr
          title="and following">ff.</abbr>
        Compare also an illustration from Arabic historical writings given by A. A. Bevan in <i>Cambridge Biblical Essays</i>, <abbr
          title="pages">pp.</abbr> 12 <abbr
          title="and following">ff.</abbr></p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    For us there is both gain and loss in these methods of the ancient writers, (<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>) Loss—because
    the continual adaptation of old tradition has sometimes produced changes so great that it is difficult or even impossible to discover now what was the actual course of events. By the exercise of care and by the diligent application of the principles of literary research the loss thus occasioned can be greatly diminished, particularly where different accounts of the same period have survived—<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    in the parallel history of Judah in Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
    and in Chronicles. Not only do the two versions facilitate the task of recovering the actual history, but each version throws light upon the origin and nature of the other. (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>) On
    the other hand, the practice of incorporating passages of older narratives in the text is a great gain. It is, of course, unfortunate that the writers did not more carefully indicate the various sources they happened to be using; but constantly—thanks to idiosyncrasies of style,
    <a id="a014"></a>language, and thought—we are able to analyse the composite whole into its component parts. From the study of the separate sources thus revealed we gain invaluable information which would have been lost to us had the later writer (or rather, compiler and editor) given his version of the history entirely in his own words.</p>
  <p>
    (3) <i>The absence of the idea of Development.</i> One other feature of the ancient writers, at least of the chroniclers of Israel, is of singular interest, and deserves special attention: it might be described as a feature of their temperament or of their mental environment. The idea of <i>growth</i> has become familiar to us, and we recognise that there has been a process of development in our religious and social institutions. We are content to trace the seeds of the present in the past. But the feeling of antiquity was apparently different. In Israel, at least, there was a tendency to suppose that the cherished system and organisations of the present had sprung into existence, as it were, <i>full-grown</i> at some great moment of the past. For example, by the Chronicler’s time, the whole body of law and ritual embodied in the final form of the Pentateuch had come to be ascribed in its entirety to Moses, whereas historical and literary evidence demonstrates beyond all question that the system of Jewish worship and law was a gradual growth of which the stages can be traced with considerable clearness. Similarly, many features in the organisation of the Temple ministrants—the Priests, Levites, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>—came
    into existence only in post-exilic days; but the whole system as it appeared in the Chronicler’s time was believed by him, and doubtless also by his contemporaries, to have originated with King David. Indeed, it is very probable that the ancients felt it so natural and so necessary to justify important customs and institutions by giving them the sanction of an ancient and honourable origin, that occasionally the very ideals of the present were represented as facts of the past. The converse of this tendency was also in force. As the present sought the support of the authority of the past, so the past could only continue to be
    <a id="a015"></a>deemed important provided it conformed to some extent with the beliefs and ideals of the present. Ideas change and expand. Thus it was quite impossible in the Chronicler’s time to represent the age of David and Solomon as great and glorious unless the moderate figures given in Kings were altered to correspond with the ideas of men accustomed to think of the mighty armies of the Persian monarchs or of Alexander the Great. As Kuenen says, “In ancient times, and specifically in Israel, the sense of historic continuity could only be preserved by the constant compliance on the part of the past with the requirements of the present, that is to say by the constant renovation and transformation of the past. This may be called the Law of religious historiography” (<i>The Modern Review</i>,<abbr
      title="volume 1"> vol. i.</abbr> [1880], <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 705).</p>
  <p>
    One consequence of the first importance follows from this fact. An ancient historical writing often records unconsciously far more than the history of the period it purports to describe. Since much in it which is ascribed to a past age in reality reflects the conditions of the present, it follows that the work <i>as a whole</i> may be an invaluable commentary on the author’s own period. By taking into account this law of religious historiography, by studying the writer’s method of compilation, his use and manipulation of sources and the additions he has himself made to the story, we shall find in the completed book a mirror of the thoughts, the ideals, and the conditions of the age when it was produced.</p>
  <p>
    Justification for these remarks can be drawn not only from the writings of the Old Testament but also from the study of ancient literature in general. Nowhere, however, are the principles and characteristics which we have outlined more clearly exemplified than in the books of Chronicles. They are the key to the comprehension of Chronicles; and, if they are borne in mind, what is generally considered a somewhat dull book of the Bible will be seen to be one of the most instructive pieces of ancient literature. At the same time, we shall be in a position to perceive and appreciate the religious enthusiasm which animated the Chronicler.</p>

  <h3 class="sectbrk h3head">
    § 2. <span class="smcap">Relation to Ezra and Nehemiah</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    It is well known that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book; but further it is certain that Chronicles has been artificially separated from them, and that the three books, Chronicles-Ezra-Nehemiah, were once a continuous work. The reasons upon which this conclusion is based are as follows:</p>
  <p id="a016a">
    (1) The ending of Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra are the same (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 22 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr> = Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>3<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>), <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    after the separation was made between Chronicles and Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    the opening verses of Ezra (recording the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return) were retained, or perhaps one should say, were added by someone who was aware of the original continuity of Chronicles with Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    and who was anxious that Chronicles
    should end in a hopeful strain (see <a
      href="#b352">note</a> on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 23).
    The desirability of securing a hopeful conclusion is much more obvious in the Hebrew than in the English Bible, for, whereas in the English order Ezra immediately follows Chronicles, in the Hebrew Canon Ezra and Nehemiah are made to precede Chronicles, and Chronicles is actually the <i>last</i> book of the Hebrew Bible. (On the reason for this order in the Hebrew, and generally on the separation of Chronicles from Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah, see <a
      href="#a056a">§ 9</a>, <i>Position in the Canon</i>, <abbr
      title="at the end">ad fin.</abbr>)</p>
  <p>
    (2) The same general standpoint and the same special interests are found both in Chronicles and Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    to a remarkable degree. In particular, attention may be called to the following points:</p>
  <div class="ml_20 padl_10 hang_10 parabrk">
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">a</span>) The same fondness for lists and genealogies is shown in both works; compare <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> with Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> <i>or</i> Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr>; and 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 31">xxxi.</abbr> 16<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19 with Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 63<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>65.</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">b</span>) The same intense interest in religious festivals and institutions; compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15, 16">xv., xvi.</abbr>; 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 5 through 7, 29, 30, 35">v.‒vii.,
        xxix., xxx., xxxv.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19, with Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 3, 6">iii., vi.</abbr> 16<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>22; Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter ">viii</abbr>.</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">c</span>) Three classes of Temple attendants, <abbr
        title="in particular">viz.</abbr>
      Levites, singers, and porters, which are barely mentioned in the rest of the Old Testament, receive a great deal of notice both in Chronicles and in Ezra<abbr
        title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah.</p>
  </div>
  <p id="a017">
    (3) The same style and diction are found in both works (excepting of course in such sentences and passages as are transcribed from older sources). Characteristic phrases are the following:</p>
  <div class="ml_20 padl_10 hang_10 parabrk">
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">a</span>) “Fathers’ houses”; compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 2, note.</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">b</span>) “The house of God,” very frequently in Chronicles<abbr
        title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
        title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
      in place of the usual “house of the <span
        class="smcap">Lord</span>”
      (Jehovah). With this compare the avoidance of the use of the name Jehovah (Jahveh) in such places as 2 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 4
      (compare Authorized Version with Revised Version), <abbr
        title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 12, 30; Ezra <abbr
        title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 18, 21.</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">c</span>) “genealogy” (“reckon by genealogy”); compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 17, note; Ezra <abbr
        title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 62.</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">d</span>) “to oversee”; 1 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 4; 2 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 2 [<abbr
        title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 1 Hebrew]; Ezra <abbr
        title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 8
      (Revised Version “to have the oversight”).</p>
    <p>
      (<span class="txt_i">e</span>) “willingly offer”; 1 Chronicles <abbr
        title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 14; Ezra <abbr
        title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 6.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    These are merely a few instances out of very many which might be given. This similarity of style and language is far more striking in the Hebrew (compare <a
      href="#a017a">§ 3, C</a>,
    and for full particulars the long list in Curtis, <i>Chronicles</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 27 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).</p>
  <p>
    When fully stated, the evidence indicated under (2) and (3) above is of a convincing character, and the conclusion that Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    were at one time a single work should be unhesitatingly adopted.</p>

  <h3 class="sectbrk h3head">
    § 3. <span class="smcap">Date and Authorship</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    (1) <i>Date and Unity.</i> The scope of our inquiry in this section requires to be defined with some care. In dealing with any work which is chiefly a compilation of older material, it is necessary clearly to distinguish between the dates of the various sources which can be recognised or surmised and the dates of the writer or writers who have effected the compilation. When we examine the structure of Chronicles its composite nature is at once evident. Many long and important passages have been taken, with or without adaptation, directly from the existing books of Scripture. The date of all such passages, of course, falls to be considered in the commentaries on Samuel
    <a id="a018"></a>or Kings or wherever their original setting may be. The remainder of Chronicles presents an intricate but interesting problem. It has been held that there are no sources involved in this remaining portion but that the whole is the free composition of the writer who quoted or adapted the passages from earlier books of Scripture referred to above. According to the view taken in this volume, sources other than these “canonical” books were utilised in the formation of Chronicles, although for reasons suggested in § 5 (<abbr
      title="which see">q.v.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 36">pp. xxxvi</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>)
    such sources are not easy to distinguish from the work of the compiler himself. The little which can be said regarding the origin and history of these supposed sources may conveniently be reserved for the section dealing with the <i>Sources</i> (<a
      href="#a029">§ 5</a>).
    The question, therefore, which is before us in this section is the date of the editorial process to which we owe the present form of Chronicles. Fortunately the answer is simplified by one important fact, namely the remarkable homogeneity of Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah.
    To such a degree are these books characterised by unity of style, vocabulary, standpoint and purpose (see below; also <a
      href="#a016">§ 2</a> and <a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a>),
    that we may safely conclude they are essentially the product of one mind: they have reached <i>substantially</i> their present form in the course of a single editorial process. Conceivably the work was achieved by a small body of Levites (see below under <a
      href="#a023a"><i>Authorship</i></a>),
    contemporaries, sharing the same training and outlook; but it is much more reasonable to infer the activity of a single writer—the <i>Chronicler</i>. It is his date which we proceed to consider. The evidence may be grouped under three heads, of which the last two (B, C) are of chief importance.</p>
  <p>
    (A) (1) In 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 7
    a sum of money is reckoned in <i>darics</i>, a Persian coinage introduced by Darius <abbr
      title="the First">I</abbr> (521<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>486 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>).</p>
  <p>
    (2) In 1 Chronicles <abbr title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 19<span
      class="txt_i">b</span><abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>24 (see <a
      href="#b024">note</a> <abbr
      title="in the same place"><i>ad loc.</i></abbr>)
    according to the Hebrew the line of David’s family is traced to the sixth generation after Zerubbabel (<i>circa</i> 520 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>).
    Hence, reckoning a generation as about 20 to 30 years, this passage would indicate a date not earlier than 400 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span> or 340 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span> The Greek, Syriac,
    <a id="a019"></a>and Latin Versions, however, differ from the Hebrew by extending the line to the <i>eleventh</i> generation after Zerubbabel. That would imply a date possibly as late as 200 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    and not earlier than about 300 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>,
    but it is very doubtful whether we can here rely upon the text of these Versions, and obviously it was easy for a translator or scribe to carry the list on to his own date. This piece of evidence, therefore, for the later date cannot be pressed, although it is worthy of notice.</p>
  <p>
    Since, as we have said (<a
      href="#a016">§ 2</a>), Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    formed originally one book with Chronicles, evidence for the date of Chronicles is also furnished by any indications of date which occur in Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah.</p>
  <p>
    (3) In Nehemiah <abbr title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 22 we find the significant phrase “to the reign of Darius, the <i>Persian</i>.” Now as long as the Persian empire stood such a description would have no point when written by a Jewish writer. For two hundred years down to 332 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>,
    when Syria and Phoenicia fell into the hands of Alexander the Great, the rulers of Judea were all “Persians.” But from 332 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    onward Greek monarchs were the rulers of Palestine, and nothing is more natural than that a Jewish chronicler writing under their rule should refer to a king of the older régime as “the Persian.”</p>
  <p>
    (4) Further, in Nehemiah <abbr title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 26, 47 the phrase “in the days of Nehemiah” occurs, implying that for the writer Nehemiah belonged to the past, but, as one cannot say how near or how distant a past, the point carries little weight.</p>
  <p>
    (5) Again, in Nehemiah <abbr title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 10, 11 and 22, 23, a list of high-priests is given, concluding with the name of Jaddua, whom the Chronicler evidently (and correctly, compare
    Josephus, <i>Antiquities of the Jews</i> <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 7, 8)
    knew to have been the high-priest about 332 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>,
    at the end of the reign of Darius (Darius III, Codomannus), when the Persian Empire collapsed before the attack of Alexander the Great.</p>
  <p>
    These details, indicative of the date of composition, are as numerous as we have any right to expect in a work of the nature of Chronicles, which deals with past history. Their
    <a id="a020"></a>evidential value can of course be criticised by supposing that the passages in question are late interpolations and have therefore no bearing on the date of the main body of the work. But no solid grounds are adduced for this objection, and the burden of proof lies upon the objector. The supposition is extremely improbable, and may be dismissed in view of the fact that (B) the general character, and (C) the linguistic peculiarities of Chronicles alike demand a date considerably later than the period of Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah.</p>
  <p>
    (B) The character of Chronicles has already been referred to, but in a different connection (§ 2, <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 16">pp. <a
      href="#a016">xvi</a></abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>).
    Here the point to notice is that <i>throughout the entire work</i> the whole system of law and ritual found in the Pentateuch is presupposed as existing in its final form. This system, which may conveniently be described as Priestly (P) in distinction from the earlier system to which the name Deuteronomic (D) is applied, and the still earlier standpoint represented by the Jahvistic and Elohistic writers (J and E), may have been of slow growth, and no doubt embodies features of law and ritual which are of relatively high antiquity. But there is overwhelming evidence to prove that, as an organised and completed <i>system</i>, it cannot be dated earlier than the period of Nehemiah (<i>circa</i> 425 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>).
    Now in Chronicles not only is this final code in force; it has evidently been so long and so firmly established that the Chronicler did not know, or at least did not believe, that any other earlier system had once ruled the practice of Israel. He belonged to a period when the development of the Pentateuch was no more remembered, and when its origin—in all completeness—had come to be ascribed with absolute confidence to the remote past, in accordance with that religious instinct which we have described above on <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 16">p. <a
      href="#a016">xiv</a></abbr>.
    Manifestly, a considerable lapse of time after Nehemiah’s period must be allowed for that conviction to have become established.</p>
  <p>
    Another consideration is found in the attitude of the Chronicler towards the kingdom of Israel. For the apostate Northern Kingdom the Chronicler has only contempt and hatred and displays no interest whatever in its fortunes, except that he
    <a id="a021"></a>takes pains occasionally to indicate the corruption of the North, thus emphasising by contrast the virtue of the Judeans. His absorption in the affairs of Jerusalem and his bitter antagonism to the North in all likelihood reflect the anger felt by the post-exilic Jews of Jerusalem against the Samaritans after the famous schism between the two communities. Indeed it is possible, <a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a> (1),
    that his work was directly inspired by the necessity of combating the religious pretensions of the Samaritans with their Temple on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Gerizim,
    rivalling Jerusalem. The Samaritan schism is generally supposed to date from 432 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>,
    but there are grounds for thinking that it was not so early, and <i>possibly</i> the Temple on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Gerizim
    may have been built, not in 432, but in 332 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    If the later date be correct, we have strong evidence for dating Chronicles not earlier than the last half of the fourth century <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span></p>
  <p>
    (C) The late date of Chronicles is finally put beyond all doubt by the linguistic peculiarities of the book. Excluding, of course, the passages drawn from earlier Scriptures, the Hebrew of Chronicles is of such a character that it is impossible to assign anything but a late post-exilic date for its composition. In every aspect of language—grammar and syntax and vocabulary—the diction exhibits the unmistakable characteristics of late Hebrew. It lies beyond the scope of the present volume to give details of the Hebrew, and reference may be made to the edition of Chronicles by Curtis and Madsen (<i>International Critical Commentary</i>), <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 27 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>,
    where a list of 136 such peculiarities is given.</p>
  <p>
    The <i>style</i> of Chronicles is disappointing. The Chronicler had some praiseworthy qualities as a narrator: he displays force and imagination in the treatment of the material, he knew how to add a graphic touch, and he was able to revise a story thoroughly while preserving its internal coherence (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr>).
    But he had not the gift of choice language. In so late a work we could not hope to find the strength and purity which characterised Hebrew prose of the “golden age.” It must, however, be confessed that, judged even by the
    <a id="a022"></a>standard of its own age, the Hebrew of Chronicles is clumsy and displeasing in many ways.</p>
  <hr class="tb_25">
  <p>
    From this cumulative evidence we infer that the Chronicler was certainly a post-exilic writer later than the period of Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    and in all probability not earlier than about 300<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>250 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    This is a valuable and definite conclusion, but it is important to observe that it does not fully answer the problem of the date of the <i>present form</i> of Chronicles. It remains to ask whether the text as it has reached us (the Masoretic Hebrew) is precisely the text which left the Chronicler’s hands, and, if not, what changes have been introduced. It is safe to say that the Hebrew text has been almost unchanged since about 150 <span
      class="smcap_all">A.D.</span>,
    but between that date and the time of the Chronicler is a long and sometimes stormy period. The subject, though in many ways important, is too intricate to be discussed here at length: a few remarks must suffice. (1) Like all other books of the Old Testament, Chronicles has suffered from the usual accidents of scribal errors in the course of transmission; but the changes due to this cause, being unintentional, are as a rule unimportant and can often be detected and corrected (see <a
      href="#a058a">§ 10</a>, <i>Text</i>).
    (2) More serious are alterations made by revisers or scribes who were anxious to bring the narrative of Chronicles into conformity with that of Samuel and Kings. In the last two chapters of 2 Chronicles the Hebrew text can be compared with an <i>old</i> Greek Version (1 Esdras—see <a
      href="#a058a">§ 10,</a> <i>Greek Versions</i>),
    and the comparison indicates that changes of text (see notes on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 8, 15)
    and a harmonisation of Chronicles with Kings (see note on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 5;
    compare also verse 15) have occurred in that brief section.</p>
  <p>
    Except in these two chapters the old Greek Version has unfortunately perished, and for all the rest of Chronicles comparison can only be made with a much later Greek Version, which is a translation of a Hebrew text almost identical with the present, Masoretic, form. Even so, differences are found, notably a substantial passage deleted from the Hebrew in 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 19
    (where see note). It is a legitimate conjecture
    <a id="a023"></a>that, if the <i>old</i> Greek Version were extant throughout Chronicles, considerable variations between the earlier and the present text might be disclosed. (3) Finally, internal evidence suggests that a few passages are of a secondary character; <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    interpolations by a writer later than the Chronicler: such perhaps are 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 50<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>53; <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 29<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>38; <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 20<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>31; 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 16<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19 (see note verse 17); <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 33 (see note <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 6); <abbr
      title="chapter 31">xxxi.</abbr> 17<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19.</p>
  <p>
    Interpolations on a large scale are not likely to have been made. Yet it must be borne in mind that Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    were once a continuous work, and study of Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    shows that those writings have undergone a complex literary process, involving serious omissions and transpositions. This heightens the possibility that Chronicles also, before or after its separation from Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah,
    was treated with freedom. Thus “the recurrence of 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr>, Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr>
    [both giving a list of inhabitants of Jerusalem] in a single work hardly looks like an original feature; like the more remarkable repetition of Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr>, Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr>,
    the feature seems to point to the combination of sources which were primarily distinct” (Cook, <i>1 Esdras</i>, in Charles’ <i>Apocrypha</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 19,
    but see note on <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 17).
    On the other hand the homogeneity of style and purpose in Chronicles tells strongly against the probability of large interpolations, and it is reasonable to believe that in the present text we have <i>substantially</i> the work produced by the Chronicler.</p>
  <p id="a023a">
    (II) <i>Authorship.</i> Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    contain no hint whatsoever of the name of their author, and external evidence fails us equally. From the contents and tone of the work we can infer with comparative certainty that he belonged to the Levitical order, and in all probability was a member of one of the Levitical guilds of musicians and singers (see, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 34">xxxiv.</abbr> 12, note).
    His character and conceptions can also be discerned from the nature of his work. That he was a man of strong intellect and vivid imagination is shown by his qualities as a narrator (see <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 21">p. <a
      href="#a021">xxi</a></abbr>)
    and by the consistency and power with which the whole work has been designed and carried through (see below, §§ 5, 6, 8). Beyond this it is futile to conjecture.</p>

    The books of Chronicles<abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah

    Before giving a detailed analysis, it may be of advantage to call attention to certain outstanding features. Remark that (1) the traditions of the period from Adam to Saul’s death have been compressed into a series of genealogical lists which occupy chapters <abbr
      title="1 through 9">i.‒ix.</abbr>;
    (2) the rest of the two books gives an account of the history of <i>Judah</i> from the death of Saul down to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586, the fortunes of North Israel being ignored, except for some scornful allusions to its degeneracy in comparison with Judah and Jerusalem; (3) the keenest interest is displayed by the writer in all matters connected with the Levites, the Temple, and its worship, so that an extraordinary amount of space is allotted to those subjects—note especially 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 6, 22 through 24">vi., xxii.‒xxix.</abbr>;
    2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 3 through 7">iii.‒vii.</abbr>, <abbr

    As the foregoing list shows, Chronicles by no means includes all the narrative of Samuel and Kings. In particular may be noted the omission of any account of the early life of David (1 Samuel <i>passim</i>), the <i>Court History</i> of David (2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapters 11 through 22">xi.‒xx.</abbr>),
    the history of Elijah and Elisha (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapters 17 through 21">xvii.‒xxi.</abbr>; 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 15),
    and the affairs of the Northern Kingdom with a few exceptions.</p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, Chronicles contains a great deal which is either independent of or not immediately dependent on earlier books of the Old Testament: note especially the opening nine chapters of genealogies, the last seven chapters of 1 Chronicles, and many passages, long and short, in 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 10 through 36">x.‒xxxvi.</abbr>
    The origin and significance of this new material will be discussed in the section on the <i>Sources</i>, <a
      href="#a029">§ 5</a>.</p>

    § 5. <span class="smcap">The Sources</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    From what has been said in § 1 regarding the nature of ancient historical writings it will be realised that a careful examination of the material used in the compilation of Chronicles is a necessary preliminary to the task of estimating the purpose and value of the work in its final form. Only when the extent of the sources has been determined can we say whether contributions made by the writer who combined those sources into the existing work are so great or so small that we ought to reckon him in the one case a narrator whose personality must be seriously considered, or in the other a mere copyist and compiler.</p>
  <p>
    (1) In considering the material of Chronicles, it is convenient to begin with those passages which seem to be copied or adapted from earlier books of the Old Testament. That such passages are numerous, and constitute a very large amount of 1 and 2 Chronicles will be seen by a glance at the table of contents given in <a
      href="#a024">§ 4</a>.
    Occasionally the Chronicler reproduced the canonical text <i>verbatim</i>, but generally he introduced alterations, which were sometimes both numerous and important. The discrepancies thus produced between Chronicles and other parts of canonical Scripture presented a grave difficulty to the older commentators, and the theory was put forward that the Chronicler used, not the canonical books, but the still older sources from which the canonical books themselves were built up and to which they frequently refer. It was hoped thus to minimise the divergences by supposing that the Chronicler had copied somewhat different portions of these old sources, and had approached them from a different standpoint. Not only was this hypothesis in the highest degree improbable, but the reconciliation it was supposed to effect is now recognised to be for the most part untenable. The theory is finally discredited by the fact that these sources of the canonical books <i>always</i> appear in Chronicles combined together in precisely the same manner in which they are found combined in the canonical
    <a id="a030"></a>books; <abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr> they appear always ‘edited,’ and never in their original, independent, form. It may be definitely asserted therefore that for all the passages which are common to Chronicles and other canonical works the Chronicler was indebted solely to the text of the canonical books as it appeared in his time.</p>
  <p>
    As for the divergences, real and apparent, between Chronicles and other canonical Scriptures, it is now recognised that, whilst they are properly a subject for historical investigation, they do not involve a religious problem. The old “religious” difficulty is answered by a deeper comprehension of the nature of Inspiration. The real inspiration of the Scriptures does not, as was once thought, rest upon points of historical accuracy: see the article <i>Inspiration</i> by A. E. Garvie in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>¹¹, <abbr
      title="volume 14">vol. xiv.</abbr>, especially <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 647 <i><abbr
      title="at the end">ad fin.</abbr></i>,
    648, with the references there given.</p>
  <p>
    (2) More important and difficult is the problem of the source of the <i>new</i> material in Chronicles. Nearly one-half of the two books of Chronicles is material otherwise unknown to us, and not to be regarded as mere ornamental amplification of the passages drawn from canonical sources. Rather it is precisely these new parts which give colour to the whole work, and there can be no doubt that the Chronicler must have dwelt with special fondness on just these passages. The question is, Can we discern or infer sources from which these independent chapters and paragraphs have been derived, or is the Chronicler himself their only source and origin?</p>
  <p>
    In attempting to answer that question, our first task is to note and discuss a long list of works to which the Chronicler appeals, either as authorities for what he says or as sources where fuller information might (presumably) be expected. They are as follows:</p>

        <a href="#a031a">¹</a> The noun <i>Midrash</i> is derived from a verb meaning to <i>search out, explore</i>. The word occurs only in 2 Chronicles <abbr

        in the Old Testament but is very common as a description of many works of later Jewish literature. A Midrash may be defined as an imaginative adaptation of an idea suggested by Scripture, especially a homiletic exposition or an edifying religious story. In midrashic writings “numbers are multiplied, all the details assume huger and more exalted proportions, right is always richly rewarded and wickedness signally punished, miracles are common, and prophets and kings deliver majestic, spiritual addresses, embodying the best doctrines of later Judaism” (Kent, <i>Student’s O.T.</i> <abbr
          title="volume 2"><span
            class="smcap_all">II.</span></abbr> <abbr
          title="page">p.</abbr> 20).
        Several of the narratives in Chronicles partake of this character. For later and more obvious examples, compare the stories of Tobit and Susanna in the Apocrypha.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p id="a032">
    This great array of authorities dwindles to small proportions on inspection. Of the fifteen given under A, numbers 13, 14 are uncertain but of very small importance, whilst number 15 is also unknown: it is <i>not</i> the canonical book of Lamentations (see the note on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 25). The rest, numbers 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>12,
    almost certainly were not independent works, but simply sections of some comprehensive work (see especially numbers 10 and 12), it being the custom among the Jews to refer to the sections of a large work by means of distinctive titles—compare Romans <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 2,
    “Know ye not what the Scripture saith <i>in Elijah</i>.” Thus some of these titles, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    1, 2, 3, 6, 7, may refer simply to passages in the canonical books of Samuel and Kings, numbers 11 and 12 to Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapters 36 through 39">xxxvi.‒xxxix.</abbr>
    = 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 13<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 19.
    But the others (and perhaps some also of those just mentioned) in all probability denote sections of a large history of a more or less midrashic character; and it is this work apparently which is meant by the titles given under B. To these we now turn. It is generally admitted that all four titles mentioned in B denote one and the same work, a comprehensive history of the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel. This work was <i>not</i> our canonical books of Kings, for it is quoted as containing material not found in those books. Still less was it any of the sources referred to in Kings: there is not the faintest probability that any of the new material in Chronicles was derived directly from those very old sources. The question therefore is whether in this general work to which the Chronicler appeals he had a source <i>independent</i> or <i>semi-independent</i> of Kings. Opinion is divided. Some scholars think that it was essentially dependent on the canonical Kings, merely “a reconstructed history, embellished with marvellous tales of divine interposition and prophetic activity.” Others maintain that this midrashic history had its roots not only in canonical Kings but also in traditions partly or wholly independent of Kings. The latter opinion is here preferred, but the reasons for adopting it will be best seen if we first state and consider two sharply opposing views put forward by recent writers.</p>
  <p id="a033">
    On the one side is Torrey (<i>Ezra Studies</i>, 1910) who argues that the Chronicler had no source at all other than the canonical books—all else was the product of his imaginative skill. He describes this supposed midrashic history of Judah and Israel as “a phantom source, of which the internal evidence is absolutely lacking, and the external evidence is limited to the Chronicler’s transparent parading of authorities.” The strength of Torrey’s contention lies in the fact that almost all the additional matter in Chronicles is written in one and the same distinctive style. That style has certain unmistakable peculiarities. Thus Driver in the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> <abbr
      title="under the word">s.v.</abbr> <i>Chronicles</i>, <abbr
      title="column">col.</abbr> 772,
    writes, “It is not merely that the style of the Chronicler presents characteristically late linguistic novelties ... but it has also a number of special mannerisms.... So constant are [these marks] that there is hardly a single sentence, not excerpted from Samuel or Kings, in which they are not discernible.” On the other side we have to consider the attitude adopted in the commentaries of Benzinger (1901) and Kittel (1902), following up a suggestion made by Büchler in 1899. These scholars not only believe that non-canonical sources supplied much of the new material of Chronicles, but they have attempted to analyse that material minutely into various contributory elements. According to their view the Chronicler was essentially a compiler, following his sources closely and showing such little independence as he exercised chiefly in those verses and passages where the affairs and interests of the Levites are set forth. In the opinion of the present writer that is not a satisfactory account of the part played by the Chronicler. It does not make sufficient allowance for the singular homogeneity of style and purpose throughout the book. Torrey’s work is of value as a warning against the danger and difficulty of the analysis which Benzinger and Kittel have essayed. Frequently the points which are adduced as evidence for distinction of sources are too few or too subjective to provide adequate ground for the analysis—see the detailed examination of the Hebrew provided in the edition by Curtis. But, whilst it
    <a id="a034"></a>should be admitted that this uniformity of style carries great weight and must receive careful consideration, it does not, we think, follow that Torrey’s sweeping conclusion is correct, and that behind the non-canonical passages there is nothing save the imagination of the Chronicler. To begin with, if that were true, the Chronicler would be unparalleled amongst ancient historians. The originality of ancient chroniclers was shown in the manner in which they combined, modified, and embellished the nucleus given by tradition, but they did not invent <i
      lang="la">de novo</i>
    to the extent required by this theory. Even if that be an over-statement, we can at least assert that they did not shut themselves up to their own imagination, if any traditions relating to their subject were current. On the contrary, they made use of all such available material, good or bad. And it is quite incredible that historical interest in Jerusalem regarding the old days of the Kingdom was confined to the compilation of Kings until suddenly the Chronicler produced this startlingly different account. There is very strong probability that the version given in Chronicles has a long chain of antecedents behind it. For consider, further, the general situation. The vicissitudes of time and fortune had caused great changes in the population of Jerusalem, but none that made absolutely impossible the continuance of traditions not represented or only partially represented by the narratives crystallised in Kings. Thus “we may safely assume that the overthrow of Edom (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>13) and the leprosy of Uzziah (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 16<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23)
    were once told more fully than in the brief verses of 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 7, <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 5.
    We may surely allow links between the impression left upon tradition by these events and the stories that have been preserved by Chronicles” (S. A. Cook, in the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>, <abbr
      title="volume 12">xii.</abbr> 470).
    It is now generally recognised that the depopulation of Jerusalem in 586 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    was not nearly so complete as was once thought, and considerable continuity of tradition may have been maintained. Moreover, the influx of South Judean families in the exilic and post-exilic times must have meant an extension of popular tales concerning
    <a id="a035"></a>Judean affairs. It is therefore significant that the South Judean “strain” is a marked feature in the Chronicler’s history. Again, it is practically certain that Levitical predecessors of the Chronicler felt somewhat the same interest as he displays in the origins of their order and institutions. Are we to suppose that they made no attempts to gratify their curiosity, or to find historical grounds for their claims? Surely they would seize with interest on any and all current traditions, and would be constantly collating them with the well-known version in Kings, adding whatever they could to the total, and no doubt tending to retell the whole—at least the popular and edifying portions of the narrative—in terms more agreeable to the ideas and practices of their own time. We cannot suppose that the Chronicler was the first and only Levite who attempted to satisfy the obvious need (<a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a>)
    for an orthodox ecclesiastical version of Judean history. Features of the genealogies, and in particular the Levitical <i>data</i>, suggest the existence of statistical records, if of nothing more. One further small but interesting point deserves mention. In 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 9, <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 23, <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 18
    there are sayings which cannot possibly originate with the Chronicler, for they are written in an archaic style utterly foreign to his manner of speech. Of these <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 18
    is poetical in form, while the other two are sentences of a type made familiar to us by early passages in Genesis. These verses, then, are certainly not the invention of the Chronicler, and, even if they are only isolated fragments, their existence is at least significant. In fine, the natural supposition is that in post-exilic Jerusalem there were various traditions which were drawn partly, but <i>not exclusively</i>, from the particular recension of history preserved in Kings, and which continued to develop in form and perhaps in content after the “Kings” recension was relatively fixed. Whether these developments of traditions, canonical <i>and</i> otherwise, preserve any genuine history or not (<a
      href="#a042a">§ 7</a>), their existence in popular and priestly circles of the Chronicler’s time is, we think, almost certain; and it is quite certain that, if they were in existence, the Chronicler would
    <a id="a036"></a>utilise them. On this view, then, the sources of the Chronicler were:</p>
  <p>
    (<span class="txt_i">a</span>) The canonical books.</p>
  <p>
    (<span class="txt_i">b</span>) Variant forms of a few narratives in Kings; traditions of South Judean origin, recording movements of population and hostilities with southern tribes; popular midrashic tales; family statistics and genealogies, particularly of the Priests and Levites; records or traditions relating to the Temple, the fortifications of Jerusalem, and the repair of certain Judean towns—<i>some</i> of this material being really independent of the traditions in Kings.</p>
  <p>
    The problem raised by the stylistic uniformity of the new passages in Chronicles must now be considered. Probably the material indicated in (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>)
    above may at times have crystallised into definite midrashic writings. (Thus, when the Chronicler speaks of the “History of the Kings of Judah and Israel,” we may believe that he refers to some such document, one that was either extant in his own age or was generally known to have existed.) Probably, however, it was also to a large extent in a fluid oral condition—matter of common knowledge and of common talk in Levitical circles. Certainly it is legitimate to think that with this material, written or oral or both, the Chronicler was intensely familiar; and that he could easily have related it <i>in his own words</i>. We may surmise that his procedure was somewhat as follows: He made the well-known narrative of Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
    the basis of his version, altering its words as little as possible, yet, if necessary, exercising great freedom, so as to make it fully orthodox in accordance with the ecclesiastical standards of his time. Into this groundwork he wove with admirable skill new material of fact and narrative, drawn from the sources set forth in (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>)
    above; and all this new material he selected, revised, and related in such a fashion as might best serve the very definite religious, moral, and ecclesiastical ends (<a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a>) which his history was designed to meet. It passed, in fact, freely and effectively through the medium of his mind; so that it appears, if not wholly in his own words, at
    <a id="a037"></a>least coloured by his distinctive turns of speech. A second way in which we can explain the uniform style of the new matter in Chronicles and escape the conclusion that it has all been derived from the imagination of the Chronicler is to suppose that for some time past it had been transmitted through the talk or writing of Levites like-minded with the Chronicler and sharing the same ecclesiastical fashion of speech; that, in fact, much of Chronicles was built up by chroniclers before the Chronicler. There may be some truth in this argument; for, as was said above, the Chronicler was surely not the first Levite to feel the need for an “orthodox” history. The two explanations can be regarded as supplementary rather than alternative; but the present writer considers that stress should be laid chiefly upon the first.</p>
  <p>
    This investigation of the structure of Chronicles yields the following general result. The position here taken is opposed to the theory that the whole of the new material was the product of the Chronicler’s imagination and literary skill. It leaves open the valuable possibility that the new material may preserve historical facts and traditions independent of those in Kings. On the other hand it admits that the Chronicler has had an important share in shaping the material and that (<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>)
    the consequent uniformity of style renders any attempt to analyse the new matter into its proximate sources precarious (observe, however, that the <i>immediate</i> history of the sources behind the new material is not of such primary importance to us as is the fundamental conclusion that there <i>were</i> such sources): and (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>)
    whilst each part of the new matter is entitled to a thorough examination on its merits, great care must be exercised to determine exactly what part the Chronicler has played. Thus it is probable that some features of the narratives in Chronicles may <i>originate</i> with the Chronicler: that is only what we should expect from a man able to plan and carry through a work so clearly intentioned and on such a large scale as Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah.
    He may have told his tale not only in his own words, but in his own way. We must be on our guard
    <a id="a038"></a>therefore to make allowance for the strength of his convictions, for his conception of the course of history and for the intentions with which he wrote. How far these considerations affect the historical value of his work will be dealt with below (<a
      href="#a042a">§ 7</a>).</p>
  <p>
    This discussion of the sources may conclude by emphasising the remarkable skill of the composition. The passages taken direct from the earlier Scriptures have been so admirably combined with the new material that the component parts have been wrought into a real unity. It is evident we are dealing with an author of strong personality. What the aim and purpose of this writer were we may now proceed to consider.</p>

  <h3 class="sectbrk h3head">
    § 6. <span class="smcap">The Purpose and Method of the Chronicler</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    (1) In the time of the Chronicler the position of the orthodox party in Jerusalem, whose interests, civil and ecclesiastical, were bound up with the worship at the Temple on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Zion,
    was one of considerable difficulty. During the Greek period (from 330 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>)
    the mental horizon of the Jews in Jerusalem had expanded even more than under the Persian rule (538<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>330 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>).
    They were now able to realise their isolation and political insignificance, whilst at the same time the communities of Jews scattered in all the leading countries of the ancient world were rapidly growing in size, influence, and in cosmopolitan outlook. Even the religious supremacy of Jerusalem was threatened. We now know that there was an important Jewish Temple at Elephantine in Egypt, which the Jewish community there was eager to maintain. But far more serious was the Samaritan schism and the Temple to Jehovah erected by them on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Gerizim.
    We can well imagine that a rival Temple on <i>Palestinian</i> soil claiming, no doubt with some show of justice, that there were true Levitical families among its priests, that its ritual was correct and its observance of the Law every whit as sound as that in Jerusalem, was a matter of vital importance
    <a id="a039"></a>to the ecclesiastical orders at Jerusalem. Undoubtedly the feud was bitter in the Chronicler’s time; and there are strong grounds for holding that Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    were written with the immediate object of confuting the ecclesiastical pretensions of the Samaritans and of showing that in Jerusalem only ought men to worship. Certainly Chronicles is well adapted for that end. A virulent polemic would have been discounted as a party document. The Chronicler instead has skilfully retold the story of the past, so as to leave two main impressions. In the first place, by ignoring the affairs of the Northern Kingdom, save where he intimates that its people were religiously degenerate from the start (see 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 8">xiii.</abbr> 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>12),
    that they were grievously decimated by a great disaster (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 13<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>17),
    and that in general their attitude on the subject of mixed marriages was scandalously lax (see Ezra and Nehemiah), he has subtly but forcibly created the impression that the Samaritans were little better than “a heterogeneous mob of heathen.” Secondly and chiefly, his history was intended to show that Jerusalem, with its Temple on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Zion,
    is the <i>one</i> place which Jehovah has chosen, and where He has set His Name. There alone was His worship properly and legitimately established, and there alone can it still be carried on. Jerusalem too, like Samaria, had suffered for its sins, but the disaster of the exile, the break in the succession, was repaired, he argues, through the return from Babylonia of that company of Israelites of pure descent whom Ezra led back: the genealogies which are so noticeable a feature of Chronicles<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah
    are given as irrefutable proof that the Jerusalem community of the Chronicler’s day—Levites and laymen—were the true and only descendants of the nation of old. It followed that by them alone could the worship of Jehovah be lawfully conducted.</p>
  <p>
    It seems very probable that the Chronicler’s work was directed specifically against the Samaritans. But in any case it is undoubtedly true that the essential purpose of the book was to vindicate the religious supremacy of Jerusalem, and to
    <a id="a040"></a>exalt the honour and the privileges of its priesthood and its Temple.</p>
  <p>
    (2) In seeking to achieve this aim, the Chronicler inevitably dwelt upon those aspects of life and thought in which he specially believed. Thus we may distinguish various features of his work which subserve the main purpose:</p>
  <p>
    (<span class="txt_i">a</span>) He was anxious, for instance, to uphold the <i>political</i> supremacy of Jerusalem, no easy matter in his time. To Jews of the Greek period, fully aware of the pomp and power of heathen states, the achievements of even such national heroes as David or Solomon probably seemed pale and insignificant, as they are related in Samuel or Kings. In order to create a due sense of their importance, and to mitigate the depressing effects of Jerusalem’s present impotence, the Chronicler retold the glories of the past in terms commensurate with the notions of the present. To this end he idealised the great men of Israel. Thus the life of David is related by him as a career of almost unbroken success and of consistent piety. Thus also the sacrifices offered by Solomon at the dedication of the Temple are said to have been on a scale that might well have astonished Alexander the Great.</p>
  <p>
    (<span class="txt_i">b</span>) Chiefly, however, the Chronicler was concerned with the <i>religious</i> pre-eminence of Jerusalem. He delights therefore in magnifying to the full the glories of the Temple, its ritual and its officers. It is quite clear that his interest in this theme is far wider than any immediate polemical aim, and the subject deserves careful attention. When he describes the Temple of Solomon in terms of surpassing splendour, he is not merely seeking to cast down the pride of Samaritan rivals, he is also gratifying the longings of his own heart—how poor in comparison the outward form of the Temple he himself served so faithfully! Perhaps also he hoped thereby to excite his own love for its well-being among the less ardent of his brethren. More important was the question of <i>ritual and the Law</i>. We have already said (<abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 20">p. <a
      href="#a020">xx</a></abbr>)
    that the Chronicler lived at a time when the Pentateuch had for a long while existed in its final
    <a id="a041"></a>form, when the ritual and Law of Israel were regulated in accordance with its fully elaborated precepts; the whole complex system being supposed to have been imparted to Israel by Moses. Now, when the Chronicler and others like him turned to the historical records of their people, the books of Samuel and Kings, they found many things which must have sorely puzzled them. For those records constantly relate events in ways which run counter to the provisions of the completed Pentateuch, sometimes ignoring, sometimes contradicting and breaking, its laws and practices. It is utterly unlikely that he and his fellows were aware that those books reflect the customs of an earlier period; so that in altering their narrative (as he does) he was not conscious of falsifying history. Even if he was, we must not judge his conduct by the opinions of our own time, but remember that “he lived in an age when certain accepted theories were regarded as more authentic than recorded facts” (Kent, <i>Student’s O.T.</i> <abbr
      title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> 23).
    It is fair, however, to believe that in the inconsistencies of the older histories with the observances of his own day he saw only an astonishing ignorance or carelessness in matters of the Law on the part of the older writers—a state of affairs which called loudly for correction. For the good name of David and Solomon, for the honour of the pious Kings of Judah, as well as for the edification of his contemporaries (and, maybe, for the confusion of the Samaritans), such flagrant blemishes had to be removed. And in Chronicles he has produced <i>a thorough revision of the history of Judah in accordance with the principles and provisions of the completed Pentateuch</i>. Throughout the entire work this aim is consistently pursued. It must be therefore considered a main feature of the Chronicler’s purpose. The alterations of the text of Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
    which he has made on this account will be so frequently pointed out in the notes that here one simple example will suffice. In 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 18
    it is said, “And the sons of David were <i>priests</i>.” Since in the Chronicler’s time it was unthinkable that any could be priests save members of Levitical
    <a id="a042"></a>families, this statement was corrected to read, “And the sons of David were <i>chief about the king</i>” (1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 17).
    Finally, in the officials of the Temple—Priests and Levites—the Chronicler manifests the deepest interest. Throughout his narrative he is vigilant to exalt the honour and privileges of those classes. In particular, he brings the guilds of Levitical singers into prominence so frequently that it is generally supposed he was himself a member of that order of Levites.</p>
  <p>
    These remarks on the principal features of the book indicate in general the purpose and method of the Chronicler. Yet in a sense they do so externally, and behind all else, as the animating force, there lies the Chronicler’s religious faith, his zeal for God. <i>That</i> truly is his ultimate motive; but it will be convenient to reserve what may be said concerning it until a later stage (§ 8).</p>

    § 7. <span
      class="smcap">The Historical Value of Chronicles</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Until recent times the burning question in the exposition of Chronicles has been the problem of reconciling its statements with those in Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings,
    finding explanations for the inconsistencies, and combining the additional matter given in Chronicles so as to form one harmonious narrative. So baffling was the task that even the Talmudists, masters in the arts of subtle exegesis, doubted the accuracy of Chronicles, and were inclined to treat it, not as an authority for the history, but as a book for homiletic interpretation (see references in the <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i> <abbr
      title="volume 4">iv.</abbr> 60).
    As soon as the character and purpose of the book, the circumstances and opinions of the writer, are understood, the demand for harmonising the variant accounts at all costs is seen to be mistaken, and the exposition of Chronicles is thereby freed from a burden by which it has been sorely hampered. The question of the historical value of its narratives remains one of great importance, but on literary and scientific, not on religious, grounds (compare <abbr title="page Roman Numeral 30">p. <a
      href="#a030">xxx</a></abbr>).</p>
  <p>
    It will make for clearness if we approach the subject by
    <a id="a043"></a>considering first (A) the direct historical value of Chronicles, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    its worth as a history of Judah; and secondly (B) its indirect historical value as a work of the period to which we have assigned its composition, 300<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>250 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    Under (A) our discussion may conveniently be divided into a consideration of: (<abbr
      title="Roman numeral 1">I</abbr>) those
    parts which reproduce or are apparently based on Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings; (<abbr
      title="Roman numeral 2">II</abbr>) the
    material wholly or apparently independent of canonical Scripture.</p>
  <p class="chapsubhd">
    A.</p>
  <p class="quobrk align_ctr">
    <span class="smcap">Direct Value.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    (<abbr title="Roman numeral 1">I</abbr>) If the Chronicler’s version of the history was to gain acceptance at all, it was necessary to make the older well-known histories the basis of his work. And indeed he himself no doubt conceived his version not as contradictory of the older narratives but only as a more careful account of the history of Judah, paying adequate attention to the religious affairs in which he was specially interested. Hence, wherever the text of Samuel and Kings was suitable for his purpose he reproduced it exactly<a
      id="a043a" href="#n_6" class="anchor">¹</a>:
    an example is 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>34 = 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>35.
    The historical value of passages which are merely transcriptions must be discussed not here but in their original setting: obviously their value is that which they possess there—neither more nor less. We proceed therefore to consider the
    <a id="a044"></a><i>changes</i> introduced by the Chronicler in using canonical sources. They are of various kinds:</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_6">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a043a">¹</a> It must not be assumed that where the text of Chronicles and Samuel<abbr
          title="through">‒</abbr>Kings
        now coincides, it has done so always. That conclusion is only generally true. Sometimes, it seems, the <i>original</i> text of Chronicles
        was altered to conform more closely with Kings, and <i>vice versa</i> the present text of Kings is sometimes the result of assimilation to Chronicles
        Unfortunately the evidence of the extant Greek versions (§ 10) is quite insufficient to tell us how far the present text of Chronicles
        has been modified by this assimilating tendency, except in the last two chapters of 2 Chronicles where the evidence of the Greek is peculiarly full. It is clear, however, that some by no means unimportant changes have taken place in the course of transmission: see <a
          href="#a058a">§ 10</a>, and the remarks on <abbr
          title="page Roman Numeral 22">p. <a
          href="#a022">xxii</a></abbr>.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    (<abbr title="Roman numeral 1">i</abbr>) A great number of <i>minor</i> alterations have been made, conforming the older material to the Chronicler’s point of view. A few instances may be given: 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 21,
    “And [the Philistines] left their images there, and David and his men <i>took them away</i>” = 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 12,
    “And [the Philistines] left their gods there, and David gave commandment, and they were <i>burned with fire</i>.” Again, 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 1,
    “And the anger of <i>the Lord</i> was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them, saying, Go, number Israel” = 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 1,
    “And <i>Satan</i> stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.” Again, 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 12,
    “The cities which Solomon had given him (Huram)” = 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 2,
    “The cities which Huram had given to Solomon.” Compare further 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 18 = 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 17 (quoted above, <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 41">p. xli</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>); 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 12 = 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 13; 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 24 = 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 25.</p>
  <p>
    (<abbr title="Roman numeral 2">ii</abbr>) In some instances the alterations are so many or of so radical a nature that the whole tenour of the passage has been transformed—<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    the conspiracy against Athaliah which resulted in the coronation of the youthful king Joash (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr>) is rewritten (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr>)
    to agree with the usages of the Temple in the Chronicler’s time. Similarly in the passage which follows (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>14), which is certainly based on 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16,
    only some 30 words of the original have been kept, so freely has it been revised. Again, the account of the destruction of Jehoshaphat’s fleet (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 48 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>)
    is remarkably altered in 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 35<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>37. Compare further 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 25<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>28 = 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 12<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15; 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9 = 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 27, 28; 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 32">xxxii.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23 = 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 13<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 37 (a free abridgment).</p>
  <p>
    (<abbr title="Roman numeral 3">iii</abbr>) Another noteworthy feature in the Chronicler’s treatment of the canonical sources is his <i>omissions</i>. These call for mention here because they are not only significant of his feelings and principles, but they also have an immense effect on the impression conveyed by his narrative as compared with
    <a id="a045"></a>that of his source. Not a word, for instance, is said that would detract from the picture of David as the man after God’s heart and the ideal monarch of Israel. The perils of his youth, Saul’s enmity and the long struggle against Ishbosheth are omitted<a
      id="a045a" href="#n_7" class="anchor">¹</a>.
    His murder of Uriah and the disastrous rebellion of Absalom are ignored; but the result is a David very different from the great yet sometimes erring monarch depicted in Samuel (see the head-note to 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr>).
    Another significant omission is 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 14<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16,
    Hezekiah’s payment of tribute to Babylonia, a tradition which doubtless seemed to the Chronicler a sign of weakness and lack of faith incredible in a king so pious and successful. Above all, we notice the omission of the affairs of the Northern Kingdom, except for a few derogatory notices. The consequence is that if Chronicles stood <i>alone</i>, our conception of the relative importance of Judah as compared with Israel would be very far removed from the actual facts. It is a simple matter to see how imperative it is that the impression given by Chronicles should here be corrected by the records in Kings, and the student will find it instructive to consider the point with some care.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_7">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a045a">¹</a> Such omissions are very skilfully managed by the Chronicler. Even so, they generally entail some abrupt transition or obscurity, as in the present instance for which see the note on 1 Chronicles <abbr
          title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 1.
        Here the cause of the obscurity can be shown by direct comparison of the earlier history in Samuel. Mark how usefully Chronicles thus demonstrates the <i>legitimacy</i> of the argument that similar difficulties elsewhere in the Old Testament
        are perhaps due to a similar cause, although the earlier source may not be extant to prove that the conjecture is correct.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    The conclusions to be drawn from the above are clear. First, in passages of the type instanced in (<abbr
      title="Roman numeral 2">ii</abbr>)
    above, where the differences between Kings and Chronicles are considerable and not confined to changes made on transparently religious grounds, the possibility that we have to do with a variant form of the tradition in Kings should be carefully considered. If there be any such distinct traditions, even though they are few or in a late stage of development, they are of high value, for they <i>may</i> be as worthy of consideration as the form in Kings. Moreover a slight variation in a tradition may occasionally
    <a id="a046"></a>suffice to indicate the existence of a different standpoint towards an important topic or period in the history. But in the majority of <i>all</i> cases included under this heading (<abbr
      title="Roman numeral 1">I</abbr>)
    it appears that the changes in the narratives were arbitrarily made in consequence of the standpoint, beliefs, and purpose (§§ 1 and 6) of the Chronicler, and they can make no claim to rest on historical facts. For the detailed arguments upon which this general conclusion is based, the reader is referred to the notes on the text.</p>
  <p>
    (<abbr title="Roman numeral 2">II</abbr>) The <i>additional</i> matter of Chronicles includes a variety of subjects. These may be roughly but conveniently summarised under the following headings—(1) <i>genealogical lists</i> (1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 2 through 9">ii.‒ix.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="chapters 23 through 27">xxiii.‒xxvii.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>);
    (2) <i>topographical and other archaeological notices</i> (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr

    and notably the organisation of the Levites, 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 23, 24">xxiii., xxiv.</abbr>,
    and details regarding the building of Solomon’s Temple, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapters 2 through 4">ii.‒iv.</abbr>,
    <i>passim</i>); (3) <i>letters and speeches</i> (1 Chronicles <abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>15);
    (4) <i>national events, especially religious affairs and wars</i> (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 34<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>43, <abbr

      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr> 27),
    such topics being sometimes related in the style of (5) <i>Midrashim</i>—<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    edifying tales describing marvellous deliverances from foes and splendid religious ceremonies (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>20, <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 9<abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>30<a
      id="a046a" href="#n_8" class="anchor">¹</a>).
    If, as Torrey contends, the whole of this is simply the product of the Chronicler’s imagination working upon the canonical sources only and freely interpreting events in accordance with his own convictions, then, we must frankly admit, its historical value as a record of the past it purports to describe is <i>nil</i>. If, however, according to the view taken in this volume (see <a
      href="#a029">§ 5</a>),
    much of this material is drawn from a body of tradition, oral and written, current in the Jerusalem of the Chronicler’s day, and not represented in canonical writings, the question of
    <a id="a047"></a>historical value is still open. Our task, then, is to consider whether among the extra-canonical traditions some genuine historical facts may have been preserved. The problem is not easy, and, as yet, it does not admit of so exact and definite a reply as we should like to give. Obviously the answer requires a thorough consideration of each <i>item</i> of the new material, a task which would far exceed the scope of this introduction. There are, however, some general observations which throw light upon the problem. These we shall give here, reserving the discussion of individual passages for the notes. Taking the subjects enumerated above in order, we have:</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_8">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a046a">¹</a> The subjects thus classified are not, of course, mutually exclusive—thus a letter or speech and statements of alleged historical events will frequently be a part of the contents of some midrashic passage.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    (1) The new <i>genealogical lists</i>, which are so prominent a feature of Chronicles. Some of these lists are certainly not trustworthy records of pre-exilic times<a
      id="a047a" href="#n_9" class="anchor">¹</a>. But others, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    parts of the Calebite and Levitical genealogies, probably embody facts concerning the kinships and distribution of various South Judean families in pre-exilic and exilic times, and furnish valuable evidence of a northward movement (see S. A. Cook, <i>1 Esdras</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 12
    in Charles’s <i>Apocrypha</i>, or his articles on <i>Caleb</i>, <i>Judah</i>, <i>Levites</i> in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>¹¹).
    It is certain that in post-exilic Jerusalem a considerable part of the population were descendants of these south Judean clans. Surely it would be surprising if no valid traditions of their relationships, their movements and fortunes, had been preserved amongst them. There is therefore good reason for holding that some historical information (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 34<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>43)
    may be found in these lists, and it is possible that a close study of certain of the genealogies will yield most valuable light on some of the main questions of Old Testament history and literature. Unfortunately the study of the intricate problems involved is not yet sufficiently advanced to permit conclusions which meet with general acceptance.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_9">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a047a">¹</a> On the other hand they may have historical value as regards the families of Judah and Jerusalem in or about the Chronicler’s own generation—a point, however, which properly falls to be discussed under B below.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    (2) Much of the <i>topographical</i> and <i>archaeological</i> information scattered here and there in the books of Chronicles
    <a id="a048"></a>does not inspire confidence, but part may rest on old tradition; compare the headnote to 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>22.
    Many of the references in chapters <abbr
      title="1 through 9">i.‒ix.</abbr> (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 24, <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 12, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>)
    to Judean townships, whether explicitly mentioned (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 54 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>),
    or lightly disguised in the genealogical tables (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 18 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>, 50 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>),
    are valuable not only for information regarding the relationship of Jewish families and movements of southern peoples, Edomites and Arabians (see (1) above, and the note on 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 42),
    but also as evidence of the extent (small indeed!) of the territory occupied by the post-exilic Jewish community (compare Hölscher, <i>Palästina</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 18<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23, 26<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>31).
    It is further plausibly suggested that notices of certain tribes of the Northern Kingdom (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    Ephraim and Manasseh) may be regarded as indications of the extension of Judaism in Samaria and Galilee about the Chronicler’s period (see note on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 9).
    The Chronicler was singularly interested in building operations (see, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 9, <abbr
      title="chapter 32">xxxii.</abbr> 30, <abbr
      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 14)
    and some of his references to the building of fortified townships in Judea (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 5 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 6, <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>6, <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 12)
    and to the origin of buildings and gates in Jerusalem may be correct (see 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>10, note).</p>
  <p>
    (3) As regards the <i>letters</i> and <i>speeches</i> which are ascribed by the Chronicler to various kings and prophets—<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> David, Elijah, Azariah, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>—these
    cannot be deemed authentic. For example, the great song of praise attributed to David in 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 7 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    is wholly composed of quotations from Psalms of late date. Such speeches or letters are examples of a device constantly and legitimately employed by <i>ancient</i> historians as a method of imparting vividness and spirit to their narrative. The letters and speeches represent simply what ought in the historian’s opinion to have been written or spoken. The Greek historian, Thucydides, carefully states the practice: “I have,” he writes, “put into the mouth of each speaker the sentiments proper to the occasion, expressed as I thought he would be likely to express them....” (Thucydides <abbr

    (4) <i>National events</i>, such as <i>religious ceremonies</i> (<abbr

    Hezekiah’s Passover, 2 Chronicles <abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>30)
    constitute as a rule the subject-matter of (5) the pious <i>midrashic passages</i>; so that (4) and (5) may conveniently be treated together. <i>Midrash</i> is not serious history, and very probably was not intended to be regarded as such even by its author. It is earnest moral and religious teaching presented in a quasi-historical dress. In all these passages the <i>form</i> of the tale is unhistorical, and all midrashic features, such as the incredibly and often impossibly large numbers given in Chronicles,
    must without hesitation be set aside; but it does not follow that the tale has no historical foundation whatever, that the events around which it was written were originally unreliable. In an ancient writing mythical features do not afford a proper ground for rejecting a tale as historically worthless—a fact which requires to be emphasised. An interesting example is found in the extraordinary legends which attached themselves to the life of Alexander the Great and rapidly spread throughout Europe and Asia (see <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>¹¹ <abbr
      title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 550 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>).</p>
  <p>
    Perhaps the most striking instance in Chronicles is the amazing and bloodless victory vouchsafed to Jehoshaphat over certain Bedouin tribes who invaded Judah from the desert by the southern end of the Dead Sea (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>30,
    where see notes). As told in Chronicles, the story is a <i>Midrash</i>, preaching the duty of trust in God and of obedience to His will at all hazards; but it is evident that the moral and religious form of the story has been built on and around a tradition of a desert raid on Judah. Now this nucleus of the tale may easily rest on historical fact. Fierce but undisciplined invaders, advancing from the desert through the difficult country of south Judah, a land of cliffs ravines and caves, might be sorely harassed by the guerilla attacks of the shepherd population of that region, and finally broken up by the outbreak of internal dissensions, before the main Judean army from Jerusalem had
    <a id="a050"></a>arrived to oppose their advance in force. Such an event would quickly fade from the military recollections of Jerusalem, but might be long perpetuated as a <i>local</i> tradition among the shepherd class of the district where the victory was won. Thus we should have, on the one hand, a reason for its non-appearance in the earlier <i>strata</i> of memories embodied in Kings. On the other hand, when the South Judean families had moved northward to Jerusalem in the exilic and post-exilic days, the story would gain currency, and one can easily see how suitable it was for development into just such a religious narrative as we find in Chronicles. The raid, then, is probably a genuine tradition, but, even so, a word of caution is required. It is necessary still to consider the question whether the story is correctly associated with the time of Jehoshaphat. Perhaps, yes; but <i>possibly</i> several such raids took place, and the memories of them may have been confused and combined into one; or, again, the names of the original foes may have been changed into those of more recent opponents. Other important passages of this type are discussed in the notes on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>20, <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 9<abbr

      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 11<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>13.</p>
  <p>
    One point calls for special mention. In the later chapters of 2 Chronicles the Chronicler’s account of the history, particularly as regards the relations of the Judean kingdom with the Edomites and Arabians to the south, is characterised by a freshness and independence which suggests that he was here relying on definite and valuable traditions (see notes <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 257 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>, 262, 280 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>, 286 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>, 292).</p>
  <p>
    These results do not provide the complete material for an estimate of the historical value of Chronicles. To them must first be added the conclusions noted below, under B.</p>
  <p class="chapsubhd">
    B.</p>
  <p class="quobrk align_ctr">
    <span class="smcap">Indirect Value.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    Although the Chronicler says not one word directly of his own times, indirectly his work gives us much useful information concerning that obscure period. In very many ways
    <a id="a051"></a>Chronicles is a mirror reflecting the thoughts, hopes, and circumstances of the orthodox community in Jerusalem, <i>circa</i> 300<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>250 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    Indirect and unconscious though the evidence may be, it is still precious, for our knowledge of the period is so slight that all fragments of information are most welcome.</p>
  <p>
    Some of the genealogical lists yield information regarding the post-exilic population of Judah and Jerusalem. Certain references (see <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 48">p. <a
      href="#a048">xlviii</a></abbr>)
    perhaps imply the extension of Judaism in Palestine. From the descriptions of the Temple and its organisation, facts can be gleaned regarding the Temple of the Chronicler’s own age. Thus in 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    where the Chronicler ascribes to David (unhistorically, see notes <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 51 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>, 136, 145)
    the origination of the Levitical arrangements in the Temple, he gives an elaborate description of their organisation; and therein we can see a picture of the complex system and duties of the Priests and the Levites (with the subordinate classes of doorkeepers and singers) as these were finally determined in the late post-exilic Temple. Some interesting inferences can be drawn from Chronicles regarding the instruction of the people in matters of religion. When in 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9
    arrangements for teaching the Law throughout Judah are said to have been instituted by Jehoshaphat, we may be sure that some such system was in vogue in the Chronicler’s day, or, at the very least, that the Chronicler and his fellow-Levites were anxious to see it fully carried out. Perhaps schools for instructing the people had already been established in Jerusalem, and it was desired to extend them throughout the countryside as well. Significant in the same connection is the remark ascribed to Azariah the prophet (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 3):
    “Now for long seasons Israel hath been without the true God and <i>without a teaching priest</i> and without law” (compare 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 3).
    Similarly from 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    we may infer the existence of, or the desire to establish, a careful system of courts of justice under the control of the Levitical order. Again, Chronicles contributes to our knowledge of the evolution of public worship. The subject is so obscure, the details so unknown, that we may be grateful
    <a id="a052"></a>for anything which helps us to discern even broad stages in the development. Undoubtedly those flagrant abuses of worship which called forth the denunciations of Isaiah and Jeremiah had passed away. One gathers that public worship in the Temple had become an affair of truly religious significance. The prayer of Solomon is repeated from Kings, but in addition the Chronicler ascribes similar utterances of praise, supplication, and thanksgiving to David and Hezekiah, and the good kings (especially Hezekiah and Josiah) are represented as zealously active in ordering and arranging for great services of worship which the people were to attend. All this, of course, is related of the past, but from it we may infer facts of the Chroniclers present. We infer, then, a community accustomed to gather constantly at the Temple for the worship of their God. The main elements of public worship can be traced. There was, of course, the ancient ritual of animal sacrifice, hallowed for the Jews by its vast antiquity, and grown the more impressive in proportion as the literalism of the past was forgotten and men felt more vividly that the offering was symbolic of things of the spirit—of the mystery of life, of forgiveness, and of recognition that all things are the gift of God. Undoubtedly there was public prayer. It is hardly possible to read the prayers of the great kings in Chronicles and not feel that they echo a liturgy of prayer—for the individual and for the nation. There was a great and impressive service of song and of music, compare 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 12, 13:
    <i>that</i> is writ large indeed on the pages of Chronicles; and 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    is enough to tell us that the Psalter was the book of praise. We have a sufficient hint, too, that to the songs at least, if not to the prayers also, the people were expected to respond—“And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord” (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 36).
    Probably arrangements were in vogue for regular reading of the Law, although Chronicles alone would hardly suffice to establish the point (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 34">xxxiv.</abbr> 31
    is insufficient evidence). Even if it be thought that this picture represents rather the ideals of the Levites than the actual attainments of the community, it is
    <a id="a053"></a>still important that such a standard of worship was conceived by the priests and set before the people. One recalls the words of the great prophet of exilic or post-exilic times who wrote: “for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples” (Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 56">lvi.</abbr> 7).
    His was a vision of the Temple as the centre of the whole world’s worship. To the Chronicler it had at least become a true “house of prayer” for Israel. Other details might be mentioned, but these will suffice to indicate the light which Chronicles throws upon the <i>conditions</i> of the post-exilic community.</p>
  <p>
    Much more important, however, is the insight we gain into the methods and principles, the ideals and the ideas which prevailed in Temple circles in Jerusalem during the third century <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    Chronicles, like all distinctive books, is necessarily eloquent of its author’s mind and character. Now the Chronicler was a Levite of the Levites, and no doubt typical of his class at this period. But we know that this period was of the highest importance in the formation of the Old Testament, and it was precisely at the hands of the orthodox Levitical circles that many books of the Jewish Scriptures, especially the Laws, the Histories, and the Psalms, underwent the revision which brought them approximately to their present form. It is therefore extremely valuable that we should be able to study the psychological characteristics of a typical Levite of that age. From this point of view hardly any part of Chronicles is without significance. Thus the midrashic stories, whatever their value otherwise, at least reveal a great deal regarding the mental and moral outlook of the writer and his contemporaries.</p>
  <p>
    “Chronicles,” it has been said (Bennett, <i>Expositor’s Bible</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 20),
    “is an object-lesson in ancient historical composition.” But it ought also to teach us that history is something more than the record of occurrences. Facts are fundamental, but of profound importance also is the attitude in which we approach them.</p>
  <p>
    To sum up the whole matter of this section. Compared with Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings,
    Chronicles is of little or no value as a record of the history of the Judean kingdom. Where it differs from
    <a id="a054"></a>those books, in almost all cases the earlier account is the more accurate and trustworthy. In what Chronicles <i>adds</i>, there may sometimes be found traditional developments of genuine historical facts. Even if they should prove to be few, it is possible that there may be among them some points of high importance for our understanding of the Old Testament records. Finally, as a product of the Greek period, Chronicles is very valuable in illustrating the methods, ideals, and temperament of the Levitical classes of Jerusalem about that time.</p>
  <p>
    These results are disappointing only if we insist on treating Chronicles as a manual of early Judean history instead of as a remarkable and in some ways unique religious work.</p>

    § 8. <span
      class="smcap">The Religious Value of Chronicles</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    Chronicles has suffered by comparison with the fresher, more human, history in Samuel and Kings. It has seemed to modern taste somewhat dry and uninspiring. To the superficial reader any religious feeling in the book is devoted to the concerns of a ritual that has long since passed away, and with which we might in any case have little sympathy. And, of course, the contrast is still more unfavourable if it be made with the books which contain the noblest utterances of Jewish faith. Job in his anguish crying “though He slay me yet will I trust Him”; the Psalmist fearless of all ill since God is with him; Hosea who wrote of God “I desire mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings”—these stand on a higher spiritual level than the Chronicler. None the less, there <i>is</i> virtue, and even great virtue, in Chronicles, and failure to perceive it only argues lack of insight on our part.</p>
  <p>
    In the first place, if Temple ritual and observance of the precepts of the Law bulk too largely in the Chronicler’s conception of the religious life, he had much excuse for his attitude. In his day and generation, faithfulness to Jehovah and to that moral and spiritual interpretation of life for which the worship of Jehovah stood, inevitably involved participation in the organised services which centred in the Temple.
    <a id="a055"></a>Whatever its imperfections, the Temple at Jerusalem in his time was performing a great religious work in keeping alive zeal for Jehovah and His Law in the face of much degenerate heathenism. Moreover it is an unfair and a false assumption to suppose that his manifest devotion to the ritual necessarily or probably meant that his religion was mere formalism or his creed poorly conceived. Behind the parade of the formalities of worship burns a living faith. The freedom with which the Chronicler has retold the history to conform with his religious views is indeed the measure of the force of his beliefs. We have already noted (<abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 49">p. xlix</abbr>)
    as regards one midrashic passage that it is essentially a sermon on the need for trust in God. The Chronicler was passionately convinced that virtue is rewarded and vice is punished. He believed in a God supremely just yet merciful, One who rules directly and personally in human life, destroying evil, guiding and fostering all that is true and good. “The might of nations counted as nothing before Him. Obedience and faith in Jehovah were more effective instruments in the hands of Israel’s kings than powerful armies and strong alliances.” It is easy to smile at the Chronicler’s belief that piety is necessarily rewarded by worldly prosperity, and sin by worldly misfortune. But, if the life and teaching of Jesus Christ have led us to a deeper interpretation of life, that does not lessen the virtue of the Chronicler in maintaining his faith in God’s justice and vigilance, despite all the cruel evidences of the prosperity of the wicked. His doctrine of reward and punishment was crude, but after all he was striving, as best he knew how, to maintain the great central conviction of religion that “all things work together for good to them that love God.” Everywhere his work is dominated by the sense of right and wrong, and a clear-eyed perception of the absolute distinction between them. He brings all men and all things to a moral and religious test. The imperishable worth of Chronicles will ever be that it is the record of a man’s endeavour to present, in terms of national experience, the eternal laws of the spiritual realm.</p>
  <p id="a056">
    Finally, since the Chronicler was retelling the past in terms of the present, we know that these beliefs of his were not rules applied in theory to history and ignored in present practice. They were the convictions by which his own soul lived. No one can afford to despise a man who was prepared to walk by the light of such a faith amid the difficulties and the perils which surrounded the enfeebled Jerusalem of that age. As Curtis says, “it was under the tutelage of men like the Chronicler that the Maccabees were nourished and the heroic age of Judaism began.” We must not allow any distaste for legalism in religion to blind us to the virtues of the post-exilic Jews. The very rigidity of the ritual and the doctrine was essential to the preservation of the nobler elements in the faith. In the memorable words of Wellhausen (<i>Prolegomena</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 497 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>),
    “At a time when all nationalities, and at the same time all bonds of religion and national customs were beginning to be broken up in the seeming cosmos and real chaos of the Graeco-Roman Empire, the Jews stood out like a rock in the midst of the ocean. When the natural conditions of independent nationality all failed them, they nevertheless artificially maintained it with an energy truly marvellous, and thereby preserved for themselves, and at the same time for the whole world, an eternal good.” Chronicles may justly claim to have played a part in that extraordinary triumph.</p>

    § 9. <span
      class="smcap">Name and Position in the Canon</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    <i>Name.</i> The Hebrew title is <i>Dibhrē Hayyāmīm</i>, literally <i>The Acts</i> (or <i>Sayings</i>) <i>of the Days</i>. In the Greek Version (the Septuagint) Chronicles was regarded as supplementary to Samuel and Kings, and so received the title “[Books of] the Omitted Acts” <span
      class="fnt_serif"
      lang="grc">παραλειπομένων</span>
    or “the Omitted Acts of the Kings (<i>or</i> Reigns) of Judah.” This name, moreover, passed into the Latin Vulgate, “(<i>Libri</i>) <i>Paralipomenōn</i>.” The title <i>Chronicles</i> seems to be due to a remark made by <abbr
      title="Saint">St</abbr> Jerome,
    who, in commenting on the Hebrew title, wrote that the book might more appropriately be styled the “Chronicle of the whole
    <a id="a057"></a>of sacred history” (<i
      lang="la">Prologus in Libros Regum</i>,
    edited by Vallarsi, <abbr
      title="Book 9">ix.</abbr> 458).
    The use of the phrase is also suggested by a similar expression (literally “the book of the Acts of the Days of...”) found some twenty times in Kings, and commonly rendered “the book of the chronicles of...” <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 19.
    On the whole, <i>Chronicles</i> is a satisfactory title<a
      id="a057a" href="#n_10" class="anchor">¹</a>.</p>
  <footer>
    <div class="fnote" id="n_10">
      <p class="first">
        <a href="#a057a">¹</a> It is, however, open to the objection that an inexperienced reader may make the mistake of supposing that these references in Kings to “the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel [Judah]” are references to the canonical Chronicles.</p>
    </div></footer>
  <p>
    <i>Division.</i> The division of Chronicles into two books (as in the English Versions) probably originated in the Septuagint (LXX.); the <abbr
      title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> <span
      class="smcap_all">A</span> and <span
      class="smcap_all">B</span>
    both mark the division. It entered the English Version through the Latin Vulgate. On the other hand, Rabbinical evidence (Talmud, <i>Baba Bathra</i> 15<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>;
    and the Masōrah) and the Christian Fathers testify that among the Hebrews the book was undivided: so Origen (<i
      lang="la">apud</i> Eusebius <i>Church History</i> <abbr
      title="Book 6">vi.</abbr> <abbr
      title="chapter 25">25</abbr>, <abbr
      title="line">2</abbr>) and Jerome (<i
      lang="la">Domnioni et Rogatiano</i>).</p>
  <p>
    <i>Position in Canon.</i> In the English Version Chronicles stands next after Kings, the Historical Books being grouped together. This arrangement was derived from the Septuagint through the Latin Vulgate. The order of the Hebrew Bible is different. There the books are arranged in three sections, of which the first contains the Books of the Pentateuch, the second includes the Historical Books from Joshua to Kings, while the third (Hebrew “Kĕthūbhīm”) contains Chronicles. The books of this third section seem to have been the last to receive Canonical Authority among the Jews. Kings thus appears to have been taken into the Canon before Chronicles.</p>
  <p>
    In the Hebrew Bible the “Kĕthūbhīm” (Hagiographa) are usually arranged thus:—first the Poetical Books (Psalms, Proverbs, Job), next the Five Rolls or <i>Megillōth</i> (Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther), and lastly the three books Daniel, Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah,
    and Chronicles. This is the usual Hebrew tradition, though it is surprising to find Ezra (which begins with the closing verses of Chronicles) put before
    <a id="a058"></a>Chronicles. The wording of Matthew <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 35,
    however, “From the blood of Abel the righteous (see Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 10 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>)
    unto the blood of Zachariah (see 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 20 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)”
    suggests that as early as our Lord’s day Chronicles was regarded as the last, just as Genesis was the first, book of the Hebrew Canon. It is probable, therefore, that Chronicles found its way into the Canon <i>after</i> Ezra<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Nehemiah,
    the latter book being needed to represent the post-exilic period of the history, whereas Chronicles covered ground already occupied by the books of Samuel and Kings.</p>

  <h3 class="sectbrk h3head">
    § 10. <span
      class="smcap">Text and Versions of Chronicles</span></h3>
  <p class="secthdbrk">
    <i>Text.</i> The Hebrew (Masoretic) text in Chronicles is, on the whole, well preserved, although by no means free from textual errors (compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 28).
    Many of these occur, as one would expect, in the lists of proper names. Olstead (in the <i>American Journal of Semitic Languages</i>, October 1913) has given reasons for holding that occasionally the original text of Chronicles may have suffered from assimilation to the text of Samuel<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>Kings.
    Further, we note a few phrases and passages which seem to be scribal additions (see § 3, <abbr
        title="page Roman Numeral 22">p. <a
      href="#a022">xxii</a></abbr>).
    An interesting scribal omission of late date is noted on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 20.
    In passages which are parallel to the older canonical books Chronicles has occasionally preserved a superior reading, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr> 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 4, Hebrew and <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    “there arose war <i>at Gezer</i>” = 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 18,
    “there was again war ... <i>at Gob</i>”; or again, 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 53, “Eshbaal” = 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 8 “Ishbosheth”; or compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 14, note on <i>go not up</i>.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Versions.</i> (1) <i>Greek Versions.</i> What is commonly called the Septuagint (LXX.) of Chronicles is now recognised to be not the <i>original</i> LXX., but a later Greek translation, which most scholars (especially Torrey, <i>Ezra Studies</i>) consider to be the rendering of Theodotion. [For criticism of the view that it is Theodotion’s rendering see the article by Olstead mentioned above.] In the main this rendering is a close reproduction
    <a id="a059"></a>of the Masoretic text, and of little value except for determining the official Hebrew text of the second century. The <i>old</i> <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    unfortunately, no longer exists for 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr><abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 34">xxxiv.</abbr>; but for 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 35, 36">xxxv., xxxvi.</abbr>
    it has been preserved in 1 Esdras <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr>—a
    fact of great good fortune, not merely for the textual criticism of that passage, but for the light it sheds on the relations and characteristics of the Greek Versions.</p>
  <p>
    (2) The <i>Old Latin Version</i> was made from the <i>old</i> <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    which is now lost except for the last two chapters of Chronicles, as stated above. It would therefore be of great value for criticism, but alas! only a few fragments survive.</p>
  <p>
    The later Latin Version, the <i>Vulgate</i>, made by Jerome, is of small value, as it represents only the official Hebrew text.</p>
  <p>
    (3) The <i>Syriac Version</i>, known as the Peshitṭa, is of even smaller value for textual criticism. Unlike the close rendering of other books in the Peshitṭa, Chronicles constantly has the characteristics of a paraphrase rather than a translation. One example will suffice. For “Joel the chief and Shaphat the second,” 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 12,
    the Peshitṭa has “And Joel went forth at their head and judged them and taught them the scriptures well.” The Peshitṭa is further noteworthy for curious omissions (and substitutions), <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    The historical narrative of the books of Chronicles commences in chapter <abbr
      title="10">x.</abbr>
    with the record of the defeat and death of King Saul on <abbr
      title="Mount">Mt</abbr> Gilboa.</p>
  <p>
    The first nine chapters are occupied almost entirely by a series of genealogical lists. Starting from the primeval age, the line is traced from Adam to the origin of Israel, showing its place among the nations of the ancient world. Attention is then confined to the descendants of Israel, amongst whom the genealogies of Judah (particularly, the line of David), of Levi, and of Benjamin, are given prominence. Finally the ancestry of Saul, and a list of inhabitants of Jerusalem is recorded.</p>
  <p>
    The modern reader is inclined to regard these statistics as the least important section of the book, but the fact that the bare lists of names are so foreign to our taste should serve at least as a valuable warning of the difference between our outlook and that of the Chronicler. It is in the highest degree important to understand the motives which caused the Chronicler to give these lists of names as the fitting introduction to the history, since the same motives operate throughout the book and determine the standpoint from which the entire history is considered.</p>
  <p>
    (1) In the first place the genealogies were not recorded by the Chronicler simply for the archaeological interest they possess. They served a most <i>practical</i> purpose, in that they helped to determine for the Jewish community of the Chronicler’s time what families were of proper Levitical descent and might claim a share in the privileges pertaining thereto, and—on a wider scale—what families might justly be considered to be the pure blood of Israel. How serious the consequences entailed by the absence of a name from such lists might be is well illustrated by Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 61<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>63 (= Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 63<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>65),
    “the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz ... sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put away from the priesthood.” On the other
    <a id="b002"></a>hand the Jew who could successfully trace his ancestry in the great lists knew himself indubitably a member of the chosen people and was confident of his part in the covenantal grace and in all those hopes which the faith of Israel inspired and sustained.</p>
  <p>
    (2) The practical aspect of these lists was thus essentially connected with high <i>religious</i> sentiment. They were an expression of the continuity of Israel, a declaration that the Present was one with the Past, a witness and an assurance of the unfailing grace of Israel’s God. The genealogies therefore are in perfect harmony with the spirit and purpose of the Chronicler’s work—see the Introduction <a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a>.</p>
  <p>
    (3) Finally, in the lists of place-names and genealogies of inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem, various facts of great historical interest are preserved—see Introduction § 7, <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 47">pp. <a
      href="#a047">xlvii</a></abbr> <abbr

      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>) <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 42 note.</p>
  <p>
    Chapter <abbr title="1">i.</abbr> contains the genealogies of the earliest age, showing the origin of the nations. It concludes with a list of the chiefs of Edom. The names are those given in the genealogies of Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr><abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr>,
    but the lists are abbreviated to the utmost by the omission of statements of relationship. Evidently the Chronicler was able to assume that the connection between the names was a matter of common knowledge.</p>

    The table which follows is taken from Genesis <abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>29.
    It is geographical rather than ethnological, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    neighbouring nations are regarded as having the same descent. The world as then known is divided into three areas of which that in the north and west is assigned to the Sons of Japheth (5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>7),
    the southern to the Sons of Ham, and the middle and eastern to the Sons of Shem (17<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23).
    Had the arrangement been according to actual descent the Semitic Zidonians, for instance, would not be described as the offspring of Ham (verse 13).</p>
  <p id="b003">
    The passage, when analysed, divides as follows: 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9
    (a general table of the descendants of Japheth and Ham), 10<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16
    (an appendix to the descendants of Ham), 17 (a general table of the descendants of Shem), 18<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23
    (an appendix to the descendants of Shem). Of these four sections, the general tables, verses 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9
    and 17, belong to the “Priestly” narrative of the Hexateuch, whilst the two appendices, verses 10<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16, 18<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23,
    are from the earlier narrative known as J. For a full examination of the many interesting questions raised by this account of the origin of the nations known to the Israelites the reader must be referred to the commentaries on Genesis where such discussion is appropriate (see Ryle, <i>Genesis</i>, in this series; or more fully Skinner, <i>Genesis</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 188 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).
    Here a few remarks of a general character must suffice.</p>
  <p>
    With the exception of Nimrod the names are those of nations and tribes (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    Madai [Medes], Javan [Greeks]) or countries (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    Mizraim [Egypt]) or cities (Zidon). The names are eponymous: that is to say “each nation is represented by an imaginary personage bearing its name, who is called into existence for the purpose of expressing its unity, but is at the same time conceived as its real progenitor”; and the relations existing or supposed to exist between the various races and ethnic groups are then set forth under the scheme of a family relationship between the eponymous ancestors. This procedure may seem strange to us but it was both natural and convenient for a period when men had not at their disposal our scientific methods of classification. It must have been specially easy for Semites, like Israel, who in everyday life were accustomed to call a population the “sons of” the district or town which they inhabited. But in truth the practice was widespread in antiquity, and, if a parallel is desired, an excellent one may be found in the Greek traditions respecting the origins of the several branches of the Hellenic race. Whether the ancients believed that these eponymous ancestors really had lived is somewhat uncertain. Probably they did, although such names as <i>Rodanim</i> (verse 7) and <i>Ludim</i> (verse 11) where the name is actually left in a plural form (as we might say “Londoners”) makes it difficult to doubt that in some cases the convention was conscious and deliberate. The notion that the chief nations of antiquity were differentiated from one another within some three generations of descent from a common ancestor, Noah, is plainly inaccurate. Equally untenable is the primary conception assumed in this table that the great races of mankind have come into being simply through the expansion and subdivision of single families.</p>
  <p>
    It must not be imagined that these facts in any way destroy the value of the table. <i>Historically</i>, it is a document of great importance as a systematic record of the racial and geographical beliefs of the Hebrews. Its value would be increased could we determine precisely the period when it was originally drawn up, but unfortunately it is not possible to do so with certainty. Arguments based on the resemblance between this table and the nations mentioned in the books of Ezekiel and Jeremiah are inconclusive; nor does the fact that the general tables (verses 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9, 17)
    now form part of P, the “Priestly” document, help us greatly, for we cannot argue from the date of the document as a whole to the date of
    <a id="b004"></a>its component laws or traditions, which of course may be much earlier. <i>Religiously</i>, the worth of this table is to be seen in the conviction of the fundamental unity of the human race, which is here expressed. The significance of this may best be felt if we contrast the Greek traditions which display a keen interest in the origins of their own peoples but none at all in that of the barbarians. Ancient society in general was vitiated by failure to recognise the moral obligation involved in our common humanity. Even Israel did not wholly transcend this danger, and its sense of spiritual pre-eminence may have taken an unworthy form in Jewish particularism; but at least, as we here see, there lay beneath the surface the instinct that ultimately the families of the earth are one, and their God one.</p>

    no doubt rightly. On the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal frequent mention is made of Ku-su (Ku-u-su) “Ethiopia” in connection with Mu-ṣur “Egypt.” The Cushites were not Negroes but a brown race like the modern Nubians (Soudanese). The “sons of Cush,” however, seem to be tribes located mostly on the Arabian side of the Red Sea, verse 9 below.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Mizraim</i>] is without doubt Egypt. In form the word may be dual, and it is generally said to mean the two Egypts, Upper and Lower.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Put</i>] This people is mentioned among the helpers of Egypt in Jeremiah, in Ezekiel (twice), and in Nahum. In Ezekiel <abbr
      title="chapter 27">xxvii.</abbr> 10
    it appears among the auxiliary troops of Tyre. Put used therefore to be identified with the Libyans of the north coast of Africa, but more probably it denotes the <i>Punt</i> of the Egyptian monuments, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    the African coast of the Red Sea.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Canaan</i>] the eponym of the pre-Israelitish population of Palestine west of Jordan. Actual racial affinities are here disregarded or unperceived, for the Canaanites (except the Philistines and Phoenicians on the strip of coastland) were Semites and spoke a language closely resembling Hebrew. That they are here reckoned as Hamites and made a “brother” of Egypt is due perhaps in part to the frequent dominations of Palestine by Egypt, but more probably to the political and religious antagonism between Israel and the Canaanites, which suggested that they ought to be most closely associated with Egypt, Israel’s traditional oppressor. Note that in Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 25<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>27
    (where hostile feeling against Canaan is prominent) “Canaan” is not said to be the son of Ham, but takes Ham’s place as a son of Noah (Ryle, <i>Genesis</i>, <abbr

    <b>10.</b> <i>And Cush begat Nimrod</i>] From the parallel passages in Genesis (<abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 10, 11)
    it is apparent that Nimrod is the name of an individual, the traditional founder of the Babylonian-Assyrian Empire. As Cush is here called the father of Nimrod and in verse 8 is the son of Ham, Hebrew tradition would appear to have regarded Hamites as the founders of the Babylonian power. Possibly the Redactor of Genesis who <i>combined</i> these verses which belong to the tradition of J with verses 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9
    which are from “P” may have thought so. But in the independent “J” narrative it is very probable that Cush, father of Nimrod, represents the third or Kassite dynasty (<span

    which held sway in Babylon from about 1750<abbr

  <p>
    <i>Asshur</i>] The Assyrians, who are so frequently referred to in the

    On the other hand Hezron, a south Judean tribe (Joshua <abbr

    is a clan of the first importance in the genealogies. From Hezron are descended not only the family of David (verse 15), but also the great Calebite and Jerahmeelite clans (verses 18<abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>23
    a statement of further descendants of Hezron (verse 9) by another wife, the daughter of Machir. The interruption is not unnatural, for it is convenient to refer to Hezron’s “son of old age” immediately before the notice of his death (verse 24).</p>
  <p>
    <i>Machir</i>] the most important clan of Manasseh (compare Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 29; Judges <abbr

    The affinity of Judean Hezronites with members of the tribe of Manasseh, implied by this verse, is surprising. Whether the tradition has a basis in fact, or arose through some genealogical confusion, cannot as yet be determined. There is however considerable evidence in favour of the view that the relationship between Machir and Caleb is at least “no isolated detail, still less is it the invention of the Chronicler’s age,” and there may be real historical ground for a tradition that besides the northern movement of the Hezronites upwards to Judah there was also at some time a movement across the northern end of Edom into the lands east of Jordan, ending in the settlements of Machir and Jair in Gilead here recorded; compare Numbers <abbr

On the other hand Cook (see previous note) regards <i>Jarha</i> as perhaps an eponym of <i>Jerahmeel</i>, and, connecting <i>Sheshan</i> with the Hebronite <i>Sheshai</i>, thinks the genealogy may signify a northward movement of Jerahmeel from Muṣri to the district of Hebron.</p>

    It seems probable that the exploits mentioned in these verses are derived from some old, though obscure, tradition, and are therefore of historical value for the movements of the tribe of Simeon. Apparently we are to understand that in the time of Hezekiah a band of the wild semi-nomadic tribe of Simeon made a successful raid upon a fertile valley near Gerar (a correction for <i>Gedor</i>, see verse 39), a township on the Philistine border, taking by surprise its peaceful population who were partly Canaanites, partly settlers who had come originally from a place <i>Maon</i> (see verse 41). <i>Gedor</i>, the reading of the Hebrew
    text, was a town just north of Hebron. A raid by Simeonites on such a town is a startling, but not incredible, episode in Hezekiah’s time; but see also note on verse 40. Finally verses 42, 43
    record a further assault by Simeonites, this time against Edomite territory. For full discussion see Hogg in <i>Encyclopedia Biblia</i> <abbr

That fighting against Arabian tribes took place in the time of Saul (verse 10) is quite probable, and perhaps there is here a definite recollection of the fact. Yet conflicts on the eastern borders were no doubt frequent, and the ancient fights may have been overlaid with the memories and details of more recent struggles, and especially the names assigned may be those of later foes. Though the Hagrites are mentioned in inscriptions of Sennacherib, they seem to have grown more prominent and powerful in later days (compare Psalms <abbr
      title="chapter 83">lxxxiii.</abbr> 7),
    and their name in the Chronicler’s time may have been somewhat loosely and generally applied to the Arabian tribes near Palestine.</p>

    The identity of interests and standpoint between the Chronicler and the Levitical order has been noted in the Introduction <a
      href="#a038a">§ 6</a> <abbr
      title="at the end"><i>ad fin.</i></abbr>
    It follows that the contents of the present chapter were to him of primary importance, and doubtless these lists represent not his own view only but the developed and accepted opinion of the Levitical and priestly classes
    <a id="b038"></a>as a whole, who believed that their institution, duties, and privileges generally were of Mosaic origin, whilst to David they ascribed the particular arrangements in connection with the Temple and especially the development of the choral services. The attempt to express their faith in concrete genealogical form was inevitable and indeed commendable. But the actual facts regarding the growth of the Levitical system (see the Additional Note at the end of this chapter, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 51 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>)
    were so very different from this theory that the artificiality of the lists is apparent to modern analysis, despite the zeal and ingenuity with which they have been compiled. Some points which indicate the unhistorical nature of the genealogies, together with questions raised by the internal structure of the chapter, will be indicated in the head-notes to the several sections. It must not be thought that such inconsistencies were equally (if at all) present to the mind of the Chronicler. For him the actual existence of the pedigree uniting the priests and Levites of his day with Aaron and finally with Levi was an axiom of thought; the <i>one</i> problem was to trace it out: and he was not restrained in his search by the spirit of scientific caution which is second nature to us. Thus in the ancestry of the singers (verses 34<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>47),
    where the lack of information to supply the necessary links in the genealogy was acutely felt, Curtis (<abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 135)
    points out that current genealogical matter seems to have been naïvely pressed into this particular service on the ground of the identity of even a single name! Great allowance must be made for the Chronicler and his contemporaries. Even if part of the lists was <i>consciously</i> fabricated, that proves no more than that he was a man of his age and under the dominance of a theory. As Torrey remarks (<i>Ezra Studies</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 65),
    “he was not writing history for us but for the good of his people.” There is no case for a charge of religious insincerity. Rather the opposite is true, and his failings as a historian constantly reveal the measure of his faith as a religious man. He was so profoundly sure of the truth of the doctrine that its presuppositions, if not discoverable in historical records, might (he felt) legitimately be conjectured. For further information showing how natural and how free was the manipulation of genealogies in ancient times reference may be made to the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>¹¹, <abbr
      title="under the word">s.v.</abbr>
    <i>Genealogy</i>, or to MᶜLennan, <i>Studies in Ancient History</i> (<abbr
      title="Second">2nd</abbr> series, 1896), chapter <abbr
      title="9">ix.</abbr></p>
  <p>
    <b>1<abbr title="through">‒</abbr>15.</b> In the finished system of the Jewish hierarchy, the Levitical order is found to be in three main divisions, “families,” who in the prevailing fashion, believed themselves to be descended from the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. In verses 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>3
    this view is expressed, and the connection is traced from Levi to Aaron, the first of the traditional line of high-priests, which in verses 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15
    is given through Zadok down to the time of the Captivity. (1) The intention of the list in verses 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15
    is clear. It is given to declare the legitimacy of Jehozadak the high-priest who went into exile at the fall of Jerusalem and was accounted the father of Jeshua the high-priest of the Return (see Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 2, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>; Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">xii.</abbr> 26; Haggai <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 1; Zechariah <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 11).
    Thus upon Jehozadak’s legitimacy depended the legitimacy of the post-exilic priesthood of Jerusalem. (2) The mechanical nature of the list
    <a id="b039"></a>is very evident when it is considered chronologically. Allowing the standard 40 years for each of the twenty-three priests in the list we get 40 × 12 + 40 × 11 = 920 years. This is in agreement with the unhistorical but beautifully regular chronology of the Priestly conception of the history, which allowed 480 years from the Exodus (Aaron) to Solomon’s Temple, and again 480 years to the foundation of the second Temple (Jeshua)—the Captivity (Jehozadak) being reckoned as taking place in the <i>eleventh</i> generation of the second period. (3) The list presents some noteworthy features. The line of high-priests from Eli to Abiathar is ignored, but this is natural, since the ascendancy of the Zadokite line was ascribed to the Divine anger against the house of Eli (1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 12<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>14; 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 27).
    It is curious, however, that this list of the high-priests omits Jehoiada (mentioned in 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 9; 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 11) and Urijah (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 11 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    and an Azariah in the reign of Uzziah (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 20)
    who should come between Amariah of Jehoshaphat’s reign and Hilkiah in the time of Josiah. (4) Finally note that the list of high-priests as far as the reign of David is repeated in verses 50<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>53.
    It is a very difficult problem to determine the relation between the two lists (see the head-note to verse 50).</p>

    <a id="b040"></a>laid on the house of Eli, from whom Abiathar was descended—see 1 Kings <abbr

    were the reputed founders of the three choral guilds of the post-exilic period.

    Possibly the singers for a considerable time were not necessarily Levites, but eventually they all claimed Levitical origin, and the pedigrees here given are the supposed justification of the claim. As the elaborated system of the Temple service (<abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    was thought to have been instituted by David, the genealogies of the three singers are so arranged as to make them contemporaries of David. Comparing these verses with verses 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15,
    it is evident that the genealogy from Korah has been used for constructing the pedigree of Heman (33<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>38), that of Gershom (20<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>22) for Asaph (39<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>43),
    and to a less extent that of Merari (29, 30) for Ethan (44<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>47).
    But in the line of Gershom and in that of Merari further names were required, five in the former and eight in the latter case, in order to make the genealogies sufficiently long to reach down to the time of David and thus make Asaph and Ethan his contemporaries. When these further names are examined they are found to be of a definitely post-exilic character; and it is evident that the Chronicler or whoever constructed the pedigrees utilised recent genealogies of the singers, which for some reason seemed to him suitable. The identity of a single name in the two lists was apparently deemed sufficient cause for making the connection (see note on verses 44<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>47).</p>

    This section has been adopted with some rearrangement from the parallel passage in Joshua. In Joshua the number of cities taken from each group of tribes and given to its respective division of the Levites is first stated, no city being named; and next the names of the cities are given under each division of the Levites and under the name of the tribe from which the cities were taken. In Chronicles the cities given to the Aaronites are first mentioned by name and reckoned to be thirteen in number (verses 55<abbr

    next the cities given to each remaining division of the Levites are reckoned shortly by number only (verses 61<abbr

    lastly, these cities are separately reckoned at length by name only (verses 66<abbr

    This rearrangement is not happy; perhaps the Chronicler originally intended to give the Aaronite cities only by name as well as number, and so verses 66<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>81
    (containing the names of the non-Aaronite cities) may be a supplement to the original text. Notice that no names of cities taken from Simeon are given; but this apparently arises through the Chronicler’s rearrangement of the parallel passage in Joshua; for verse 65, which here follows the list of Aaronite cities, mentions Simeon, and in the original context (Joshua <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 9)
    it <i>precedes</i> the list.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    The priestly organisation known to the Chronicler represents the latest stage of a system, the development of which can to some extent be traced in the Old Testament records. (1) It appears from the earliest sources that the great “priestly” duty of sacrifice at one period did not require a priest for its due performance but might be, and was, undertaken by any responsible male. For example in Exodus <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 5,
    an occasion of the deepest solemnity, sacrifices are spoken of as offered by “young men of the children of Israel.” In Exodus <abbr
      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    it is clear that the other great function of early religion, charge of the responses given by the Divine oracle, is regarded as being under the control of Moses. In fact it would seem that in the earlier period there were neither priests nor Levites as a religious order; at any rate, as an order exercising a <i>monopoly</i> in the religious functions which they afterwards claimed the sole right of discharging. (2) In course of time those who administered the oracle and offered sacrifices at the manifold shrines and high places of Palestine gained importance and were recognised as a distinct religious class, <i>priests</i>; and persons claiming descent from Levi were numerous or prominent among them. But the <i>right</i> of offering sacrifices was still by no means confined to these priests of the shrines. The priesthood of the various shrines was often hereditary, passing on from father to son; and, even apart from that fact, it was most natural that members of this religious order, or perhaps one should say “profession,” should be thought of as connected by blood-relationship. Eventually they were all reckoned descendants of Levi. (3) After the exile and the suppression of the local shrines of Judah, the pre-eminence of the priests or Levites of <i>Jerusalem</i> was definitely established, and (as Ezekiel had suggested) such priests of the local shrines as were satisfied to migrate to Jerusalem became subordinate to the original ministers of the Temple there. All were accounted sons of Levi; but only the original Jerusalem priests, who traced their descent through the Levitical family of Aaron, were entitled to rank as <i>priests</i>: the rest were Levites but not priests. Thus there arose a distinction in the ranks of the religious officials. (4) Finally, the functions and privileges of priests as distinct from Levites were carefully
    <a id="b052"></a>discriminated, and the tradition that their origin as a religious order was due to Moses became firmly established, whilst the complex system of their organisation, in particular the subdivisions of the Levites as singers and doorkeepers, was confidently ascribed to David. Chronicles consistently represents this latest stage of development. For a concise statement of the facts see MᶜNeile, <i>Numbers</i>, <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>6<abbr title="through">‒</abbr>12.</b> According to the existing text these verses are a genealogy of Benjamin; but, as such, they present most serious difficulties. Notice (1) that the customary “sons of” is lacking in the Hebrew
    text before Benjamin: (2) that the sons of Benjamin here number <i>three</i>, whereas in Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 38, 39,
    they are <i>five</i> (<i>five</i> also in 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 2!), and in Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 42">xlii.</abbr> 21
    <i>ten</i>; and further that one of the sons here mentioned, Jediael, is nowhere else referred to as a Benjamite: (3) that the sons of Bela (verse 7) are entirely different in <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 3:
    and (4) that in general the names in the list (with only three certain exceptions and two of them place-names) are not elsewhere found in lists of Benjamite names—a startling fact. (5) Finally and most important of all, a genealogy of Benjamin is given in chapter <abbr
      title="8">viii.</abbr>,
    exactly where we might expect to find it according to the order in which the Chronicler describes the tribes.</p>
  <p>
    The first of these points could be (and has usually been) explained by the elision of some letters; for the words “the sons of” (Bᵉnê) in Hebrew writing most closely resemble “Ben” the first syllable of Benjamin. For a few other minor difficulties tentative suggestions have been put forward, but are very unsatisfying, whilst for most of the features noted above, and especially for the most important of them, no proper explanation can be given on the supposition that the list really is a genealogy of Benjamin. It is therefore most probable that the view urged by Curtis, <i>Chronicles</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 127,
    should be adopted. He finds in these verses the genealogy of <i>Zebulun</i>, the absence of which otherwise is a striking feature of the genealogies in these chapters. The letters which are now taken to be the first part of the word <i>Benjamin</i> should be read <i>Bᵉnê</i> (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    <i>the sons of</i>), and the following letters are a corruption of Zebulun, which was originally followed by the names of Zebulun’s three sons, Sered and Elon and Jahleel, as given in Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 46">xlvi.</abbr> 14.
    The changes involved by this suggestion may seem violent in English, but they are by no means so in the Hebrew,
    and moreover it must be understood that they all follow
    <a id="b054"></a>inevitably or at least most naturally upon the slight initial error whereby “the sons of Zebulun” was corrupted into “Benjamin.” The development and details of Curtis’ reasoning cannot be set forth except in connection with the Hebrew
    text, and it must therefore suffice here to indicate the one essential point, and to remark that the convincing feature of his hypothesis is that it furnishes a clear and natural explanation of all the difficulties noted above.</p>

  <p>
    <i>Benjamin, and Ehud</i>] The error in verse 6 by which this Zebulunite list becomes ostensibly Benjamite must have been very early. When once it had arisen, the tendency to introduce names which were to be expected in a Benjamite genealogy was inevitably strong. This is the ground on which the names <i>Anathoth</i> and <i>Alemeth</i> (verse 8) are to be explained, as also <i>Shuppim</i> and <i>Huppim</i> (verse 12). Most clearly, however, is the tendency illustrated by the present verse, where the reading <i>Benjamin and Ehud</i> most probably has its origin in a marginal addition “and Ehud the Benjamite” (from Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 15)
    which was later inserted in the text as two separate names.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Tarshish</i>] It is said of Zebulun in Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 49">xlix.</abbr> 13
    that he shall be “a haven for ships,” and <i>Tarshish</i>, absolutely unknown as a Hebrew personal name, is regularly used in the Old Testament in connection with ships
    <a id="b055"></a>and commerce by sea. It would be astonishingly out of place in a genealogy of Benjamin, but is appropriate in one of Zebulun (compare Genesis <abbr

    text the offensive name <i>Eshbaal</i>, “Man (<abbr

    has been changed to <i>Ishbosheth</i>, “Man of the Shameful-thing” (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    of the idol), but it has been left standing in the less-used text of Chronicles
    The title <i>Baal</i> (“Lord”) was applied in early days (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    in the days of Saul) to the national God of Israel, but in later days the prophets objected to it because of its general use in designation of the heathen gods also. Hosea (<abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 17),
    for example, declares that the true worshippers of Jehovah must no longer call him “My Baal” (<i>Baali</i>). Thus to Saul and Samuel the name <i>Eshbaal</i> was acceptable as meaning “Man of the Lord,” <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    of Jehovah, but to the late reviser of the book of Samuel it was offensive as signifying “Man of Baal,” <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    of one of the gods worshipped by the old Canaanite peoples or by the neighbouring nations. Since the text of Chronicles has retained such forms as Eshbaal (here), Ashbel (verse 1),
    it seems that the conscientious alterations of such forms in the books of Samuel, Kings, <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    Verses 2<abbr title="through">‒</abbr>17 contain the lists of the heads of families of Judah (<b>3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>6</b>), of Benjamin (<b>7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9</b>), of the priests (<b>10<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>13</b>), of the Levites (<b>14<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16</b>),
    and of the porters (<b>17</b>), who dwelt in Jerusalem at some period after the Return (compare note on verse 2). A similar list (with some variations which are recorded in their places in the following notes) occurs in Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19.
    The partial agreement coupled with the partial divergence of the two lists may be explained by supposing that both are extracts independently made from the same document, and have been inserted, one in Chronicles, the other in Nehemiah, lest the peculiarities of either list should be lost. We may conclude from Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 1, 2
    that both lists represent the population of Jerusalem, after Nehemiah had taken measures for increasing it. Another way of accounting for the divergences in the two lists is to suppose that the present list represents the Jerusalem of a later period than the list in Nehemiah See also verse 17.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel: and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their transgression.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>1.</b> <i>in the book of the kings of Israel</i>] See Introduction <a
      href="#a029">§ 5</a>, B (3). The <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>,
    however, reads “in the book of the kings of Israel <i>and Judah</i>.” With the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    reading, <i>all Israel</i> must be taken as subject of the verb <i>was carried away</i>, but of course the phrase must still be taken as meaning an “Israel” = Judah.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ²Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>2.</b> <i>the first inhabitants</i>] It has been thought that the word “first” here refers to <i>pre-eminence</i> (compare Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 3),
    and that the list which follows (verses 4 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    is a list of <i>chief men</i>. It is better, however, to take “first” in a temporal sense, meaning “pre-exilic,” and to suppose that the Chronicler or whoever placed this chapter here mistakenly imagined this list to be a pre-exilic register. That it is not really pre-exilic is certain by reason of its vital connection with the post-exilic list in Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19.
    The suggestion that the resemblances are due to the continuity of population in Jerusalem before and after the exile is utterly improbable.</p>
  <p>
    <i>in their cities</i>] The phrase is apparently an abridgment of words in Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 3,
    and is really meaningless in the present context. In Nehemiah
    it signifies “townships in Judah” where certain persons, who now elected to dwell in Jerusalem, had formerly resided.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Israel</i>] <abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr> laymen as distinguished from men of Levitical descent. According to verse 3
    <i>Israel</i> included at least Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh (compare Psalms <abbr
      title="chapter 80">lxxx.</abbr> 2,
    where Judah—the speaker—associates Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh with herself in her appeal to the
    <a id="b065"></a>God of <i>Israel</i>, See also note on 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr> 18).
    This is a totally different usage from that of earlier times, when <i>Israel</i> meant the Northern kingdom, and <i>Judah</i> the Southern.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Nethinim</i>] These were a class of Temple servants reckoned as inferior to the Levites. Perhaps they were of foreign extraction and included the Gibeonites (compare Joshua <abbr

    They are mentioned nowhere else in the Old Testament except in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.</p>

    But it is also reasonable <a id="b068"></a>to suppose that the Chronicler would here give a register of inhabitants of Jerusalem (which could not be included in the list of the separate tribes), and such a register would probably give a survey of the Levitical classes.</p>
  <p>
    The verses present on analysis several confusing features, see notes on verses 17, 22, 25, 33.</p>

    In Solomon’s Temple there were “keepers of the threshold,” three in number (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 18),
    priests in rank (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 9).</p>
  <p>
    A distinction between the doorkeepers and the Levites (verse 14) seems to be implied, but in verses 19, 26 the doorkeepers, or at any rate their leaders, are called Levites (compare Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 15, 19 with 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr>).
    The supposed distinction may have died out before the Chronicler’s period, or perhaps earlier and later stages are reflected in the chapter (see also the note on verse 26).</p>
  <p>
    <i>Shallum...Ahiman</i>] These two names are absent from Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 19
    together with the clause <i>Shallum was the chief</i>. This omission of all reference to Shallum must be accidental.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon</i>] The three names represent families, not individuals; compare Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 42 = Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 45,
    where the fuller form is given, <i>the children of Shallum, ... the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub....</i> These names persist in the five lists of porters which refer to post-exilic times; Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 42 = Nehemiah <abbr

    <i>Ahiman</i>] Elsewhere in the Old Testament this name occurs only among the names of the sons of Anak, and it is probable that the Chronicler (or some scribe) made here an error of transcription, and that <span

      class="smcap_all">AHEIHEM</span>

    We might expect the reference to the Temple or Tabernacle to be continued; but, as nothing is said in the Pentateuch of “keepers of the entry <i>to the tabernacle</i>,” probably the entry <i>to the camp</i>, not to the tabernacle, is meant in the present phrase. With this view agrees the mention of Phinehas (verse 20),
    for it apparently was the profanation of the camp in general, not of the tabernacle, which Phinehas avenged (Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 6<abbr

  <p>
    <i>in their villages</i>] Compare verses 16 and 25.</p>
  <p>
    <i>whom David ... did ordain</i>] The Chronicler attributes to David the organisation of the priests (<abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 3), of the Levites (<abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 27; <abbr

      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 1 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>),
    and of the doorkeepers (in this passage). It has been thought that this verse is at variance with verses 18, 19, where the Mosaic origin of the gatekeepers seems to be implied. But in answer it may be said that the Chronicler is guilty of no inconsistency in ascribing the <i>origin</i> of the doorkeepers to the Mosaic period and saying here that David and Samuel “ordained them in their set office,” <a id="b070"></a>for the phrase refers, not to their origin, but to their <i>organisation</i>. For another suggestion see below on verse 26.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Samuel</i>] The association of Samuel with the organisation of the sanctuary is confined to this passage, and is a significant illustration of the working of late Jewish thought, which was little concerned with historic probability and much with edification. The tradition has probably arisen from the remark in 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 15,
    that Samuel “opened the doors of the house of the Lord.” As Samuel died before the reign of David, the Chronicler doubtless does not intend to represent him as contemporary with David in the organisation of the Temple, but probably supposes that Samuel’s work was done in connection with the tent, which according to the Chronicler was located in Gibeon (2 Chronicles <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>26.</b> <i>the four chief porters, who were Levites</i>] It seems clear from this verse (and from the structure of the chapter, compare verses 10, 14, 17—as is pointed out in the note on verse 17) that the doorkeepers were not, as a body, Levites; and according to verse 25 they dwelt outside Jerusalem, whilst their leaders (verse 27) were within the city. Perhaps this distinction between the leaders and the rank and file could be used to explain the supposed inconsistency (if any exists—see above verse 22, note on <i>whom David ...</i>) between verses 19 and 22, as regards the tradition of origin: it might be said that whilst the leaders claimed that their office dated from the time of Moses (verse 19), the rank and file traced their institution to David (verse 22). (In 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 34">xxxiv.</abbr> 9

      The Reign of David.</span></h3>
  <p class="chaphdbrk">
    At this point the Chronicler begins his narrative of Israel’s history. It commences abruptly with an account of the defeat and death of Saul, which however is given not for its own interest, but to serve as a brief introduction to the reign of David (chapter <abbr
      title="11">xi.</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).
    Why does the Chronicler choose to begin his narrative at this point, passing over in silence (<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>) the Mosaic period, (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>) the
    stories of Judges and of 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapters 1 through 30">i.‒xxx.</abbr>? As regards (<span
      class="txt_i">a</span>)
    his silence is due to the assumption that those for whom he writes are no less familiar than he is himself with the account of the Mosaic age as presented by the fully developed tradition of the Pentateuch. As for (<span
      class="txt_i">b</span>),
    his silence probably arises neither from the difficulty of retelling the narratives of Judges in accordance with his theory of the early history, nor yet from the fact that they were doubtless familiar to his readers; but, again, from a consideration of the central purpose of his work. His theme is the Divine guidance of Israel’s destiny, and, since that destiny had ultimately centred upon the fortunes of Jerusalem and the worship maintained through its Temple, all else in Israel’s history becomes of quite secondary importance. He begins therefore where (for Israel) Jerusalem and the Temple began—with David, who conquered the city and planned the Temple. The tales of the Judges, of Samuel, and of David’s early life and his magnanimity toward Saul (a tempting source for the exaltation of the character of the ideal king), all these are logically ignored, since they lie outside the scope of the Chronicler’s design.</p>

    <b>1.</b> <i>in mount Gilboa</i>] In the campaign of Gilboa the Philistines showed new and skilful strategy. Instead of at once marching eastward up the ravines which lead into Judah and Benjamin—in which there was no room for their chariots (2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 6)
    to manœuvre—they first marched northward along the sea-coast and then turned eastward just before reaching Mount Carmel. This movement brought them into the great fertile plain watered by the Kishon, ground over which chariots
    <a id="b074"></a>could act with decisive effect. At the north-east end of the plain rose the heights of Gilboa. When Saul and his Benjamites advanced to meet the Philistines, the latter succeeded in interposing themselves between the Israelite army and its base in Benjamin—an easy achievement for an enemy who by his chariots possessed a high degree of mobility. Saul was therefore driven to take up his position on the <i>north</i> side of the plain on Mount Gilboa, where he was attacked by the Philistines, probably from the south-west on which side the slopes of the mountain are comparatively gentle. The Israelites, cut off from their homes, outmarched, outgeneralled, and probably outnumbered, were speedily routed. The battle of Gilboa was won, like that of Hastings, by cavalry (chariots) and archers (verse 3) against infantry, which was obliged to stand on the defensive, under pain of being cut to pieces if it ventured to attack.

    (the death of Abimelech). One function of an armourbearer was to give the “coup de grâce” to fallen enemies (1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 13),
    but sometimes the same office had to be executed for friends. Possibly the man refused from fear of blood-revenge, which would be the more certainly exacted in the case of the Lord’s Anointed, compare 1 Samuel <abbr

  <p id="b075">

      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 358 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>),
    where Saul’s body was exposed (1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 31">xxxi.</abbr> 12).</p>
  <p>
    <i>and dwelt in them</i>] Perhaps for a short while only, compare 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 9,
    “[Abner] made him (Ish-bosheth) king over ... <i>Jezreel</i>.” Ish-bosheth, however, may have “ruled” only in acknowledgment of a Philistine suzerainty.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">

  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>9.</b> <i>to carry the tidings unto their idols</i>] Better, as in Samuel, “to publish it <i>in the house</i> (or <i>houses</i>) of their idols”; compare the next verse. The news was published by the exhibition of trophies of the victory in the Philistine temples.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ¹⁰And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>10.</b> <i>in the house of their gods</i>] In Samuel (more definitely) “in the house (<i>or</i> houses) of Ashtaroth,” Ashtaroth being the plural of <i>Ashtoreth</i>, a goddess, who seems here to bear a martial character. (The name <i>Ashtoreth</i> is an artificial formation, the proper form being <i>Ashtarte</i>. The vowels of the word <i>bōshĕth</i>, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    <i>shame</i>, were used for the last two syllables in place of the true vowels; compare note on <abbr

  <p>
    <i>fastened his head in the house of Dagon</i> (literally <i>Beth-Dagon</i>)] In Samuel <i>fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan</i>. The reading of Chronicles is probably an arbitrary alteration made by the Chronicler out of regard for 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 31">xxxi.</abbr> 9,
    where it is related that the Philistines cut off Saul’s head. It is just possible that the variation points to a fuller original text containing all three statements—that Saul’s armour was placed in the temple of Ashtarte, his head in the “house of Dagon,” and his headless corpse fastened to the walls of Beth-shan. Beth-shan is north-east of Gilboa, about four miles distant from the Jordan, and about a day’s march (1 Samuel <abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>14

    The remaining chapters of the first book of Chronicles are occupied with the reign of David, who is represented as a king fulfilling the Chronicler’s highest ideals of piety and prosperity.

    David’s earlier coronation by the men of Judah (2 Samuel <abbr

    and the “long war” (2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 1)
    with the house of Saul are omitted not of course because the Chronicler was ignorant of these events (for see the references in verses 15, 17; <abbr

    but for the reason set forth above in the head-note to chapters <abbr
      title="10 through 29">x.‒xxix.</abbr>
    The Chronicler’s account is perhaps deliberately adapted to convey an impression of the ease with which the ideal David ascends the throne of a united Israel; and, if we had not the narrative in Samuel to help us, we should be left with a conception of the period very different from the actual course of events. How strange, too, would be the sudden transition from the picture of defeat and flight of Israel in chapter <abbr
      title="10">x.</abbr>
    to the calm assemblage of all Israel in chapter <abbr

    his household and body-guard; compare <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 6, note. The
    <a id="b078"></a>exploit recorded in Samuel is invested by the Chronicler with the grandeur of a state campaign.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the same is Jebus</i>] Jerusalem (or Jebus) consisted, it seems (compare verse 8; Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 21),
    of a citadel inhabited by Jebusites and of a lower city inhabited by a mixed population of Jebusites and Benjamites. It was the citadel only which David stormed. Jerusalem is called Jebus only here and in Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 10 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>
    The notion that Jebus was an ancient name for the city <i>may</i> be only a late fancy, but it is possible that it was sometimes so called in the days of the Jebusite rule. What is certain is that the name Jerusalem is ancient, for it occurs frequently (as Urusalim) in the Amarna tablets, <i>circa</i> 1400 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    See G. A. Smith, <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land</i>] <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    masters of that territory before the Israelite invasion. The Jebusites have been thought to be of Hittite origin, but they were probably Semites, like the Israelites (see G. A. Smith, <i>Jerusalem</i>, <abbr
      title="volume 2"><span

    ⁵And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come in hither. Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion; the same is the city of David.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>5.</b> <i>Thou shalt not come in hither</i>]. Undoubtedly the Chronicler understood the resistance offered by the Jebusites to be of a military character, and the text of Samuel <i>as translated</i> in Authorized Version and Revised Version
    follows the same notion. See, however, the reinterpretation of the Samuel text by Barnes in the <i>Expositor</i>, January, 1914, where it is urged that the word (<i>mᵉtsudah</i>) rendered “<i>strong hold</i>” means not a well-fortified citadel but simply a natural hiding place, such as a thicket or a cavern (which in this case probably was used as a shrine by the Jebusites).</p>
  <p>
    <i>the strong hold of Zion</i>] See the previous note. The site of this “hold” or cavern (afterwards “the city of David”) is on the south-east of the present city, on the south of the Haram (the Temple area), and on a level lower than that of the Haram (see Smith, <i>Jerusalem</i>, <abbr
      title="volume 2"><span
      class="smcap">II.</span></abbr> 39 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁶And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, and was made chief. ⁷And David dwelt in the strong hold; therefore they called it the city of David.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>6.</b> <i>Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites</i>] The reference here is no doubt to military violence. See, however, the article by Barnes cited above. The text in Samuel is very difficult and corrupt, and has been simplified by the Chronicler.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Joab the son of Zeruiah</i>] Zeruiah was David’s sister (<abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 16).
    It is not said in Samuel that Joab first became commander-in-chief on this occasion; on the contrary he appears in command (2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 13)
    during the civil war against the house of Saul. Perhaps he was first formally acknowledged as commander at the seizure of Jerusalem.</p>

    This section seems to consist of elements drawn from different sources and brought together (probably by the author of Samuel) in order to give as complete a list as possible of the heroes who at different times in David’s career did good service to Israel.</p>

  <p>
    Joab is not included in the formal list because he has been already mentioned (verse 6).</p>
  <p>
    Lists of names are favourite features in oriental Histories. Thus Ibn Hishām in his <i>Life</i> of Mohammed gives a list of the 83 Moslems who took refuge in Abyssinia from the persecution of the Koreish, of the 75 inhabitants of Medina who swore allegiance to the Prophet before the Hegira, and even of the 314 Moslems who were present at the battle of Bedr.</p>

    The name “Jashobeam” is however uncertain. In 2 Samuel (<abbr

    it appears as “Josheb-basshebeth,” which is certainly wrong. <abbr

    varies in reproducing the name, but it seems to have read “Ish-bosheth” in Samuel, and “Ish-baal” (Esh-baal) in both places of Chronicles. These readings are probably right. For the relation of the forms “Ish-bosheth,” “Esh-baal” see <abbr

    <i>chief of the thirty</i>] So the Hebrew margin (<i>Kethīb</i>), but the Hebrew text (<i>Ḳerī</i>) reads <i>chief of the captains</i>, which the Authorized Version follows. Neither Authorized Version nor Revised Version gives satisfactory sense. In 2 Samuel <abbr

    gives, <i>chief of the third part</i> [<i>of the army</i>], compare 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 2;
    and this is perhaps right; the Hebrew text of Samuel (if not faulty) probably bears the same sense. Ish-baal (Jashobeam) then is one of three “mightiest of the mighty” men, the other two being Eleazar (verse 12) and Shammah (= 2 Samuel <abbr

    This section describes the gathering to David of helpers from Benjamin (verses 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>7), Gad (8<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15), Benjamin and Judah (16<abbr

      title="through">‒</abbr>22)—before
    the death of Saul. It is entirely natural to suppose that the men who followed David in the days of Saul’s enmity were rewarded when he became king, and their descendants might well be prominent families in the land. Whether any such survived the exilic period and continued in later Jerusalem we cannot say for certain, but it is probable that some names in this list are correct, though it is doubtful whether the Chronicler is drawing on contemporary family tradition or on written sources. The style, however, shows that the composition of the chapter is the Chronicler’s, and the impression made by the whole should be contrasted with the picture of this period of David’s life given in 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 1 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr> In Samuel
    David is leader of a small band of his own immediate friends, augmented by adventurers and desperate men, and numbering in all some six hundred. In Chronicles one gathers that his followers were the choice spirits of Israel and Judah, who rallied to his support until he had “a great host like the host of God.” Beyond question the picture in Samuel is true to fact, that in Chronicles being part of the idealisation of David as the perfect king, which the Chronicler (doubtless in full accord with the temper of his age) consistently presents. Its worth lies not in its historical accuracy, but in the religious enthusiasm which has produced it.</p>

Its value in the idealistic account of David which the Chronicler furnishes is obvious, implying as it does not only that the northern as well as the southern tribes concurred whole-heartedly in the election of David, but also that the occasion was one of great military display. On the huge numbers alleged to have come from the North (Zebulun, Naphtali, Dan, and Asher being credited with 155,600 warriors) compare the following note, and, in general, on midrashic exaggeration of numbers in Chronicles see the note on 2 Chronicles <abbr

        to the House of Obed-edom. Death of Uzza.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    In harmony with his conviction that the acts of David in promoting or instituting the religious ceremonial of Israel were the supremely important events of his reign, the Chronicler represents the removal of the Ark from Kiriath-jearim as being the first concern of the new monarch and his first action subsequent to the capture of Jerusalem. David’s building of a royal residence for himself and his family in Jerusalem, and his victories over the Philistines, which in 2 Samuel <i>precede</i> the removal of the Ark, are relegated to the second place in Chronicles (see chapter <abbr
      title="14">xiv.</abbr>).
    The transposition of order is effected by means of the introductory verses 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>4,
    which are from the Chronicler’s own hand.</p>
  <p>
    It is convenient to draw attention here to a matter of some importance in the narrative of Chronicles, <abbr
      title="in particular">viz.</abbr>
    that the Chronicler believed the Tabernacle (<i>Mishkān</i>) of the Lord (Exodus <abbr
      title="chapters 35 through 40">xxxv.‒xl.</abbr>)
    “which Moses made in the wilderness” (1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 29)
    to be in existence in David’s day and to be standing at Gibeon (see <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 39, and 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 3).
    Yet when the Ark was taken into the city of David it was placed not in the <i>Mishkān</i> but “in the tent (<i>Ohel</i>) which David pitched for it” (<abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> verse 1 = 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 17).
    Thus in Chronicles the two holy things, the Ark and the Tabernacle, are represented as separated, and a separate daily service has to be instituted for each; Asaph and his brethren being said to minister before the Ark in the city of David (1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 37),
    and Zadok and his brethren before the Tabernacle at Gibeon (<abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> verse 39).
    The worship at Gibeon as well as Jerusalem entailed a manifest breach of the Deuteronomic law that at one sanctuary only must worship be offered. It is hard to say what the Chronicler thought of David’s strange disregard of a stringent law which (on the Chronicler’s theory) was well known to David, and which the Chronicler used as one of the criteria distinguishing the good from the evil kings from Solomon
    <a id="b095"></a>onwards. Doubtless David’s ecclesiastical arrangements were regarded as temporary, pending the building of the Temple, but surely the <i>Mishkān</i> could have been removed to Jerusalem almost as easily as the Ark. Why then does the perfect king fail in this duty? The Chronicler ignores the difficulty completely, probably because he was unable to see or conjecture any adequate explanation of David’s conduct. It goes without saying that in reality the Deuteronomic law of the one sanctuary was of much later origin than the time of David, and the difficulty is an unreal one.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹And David consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>1.</b> <i>David consulted with the captains</i>, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>]
    The Chronicler is fond of associating the people with the king in religious measures so as to minimise the appearance of arbitrary power which is suggested by the language of the books of Samuel and of Kings; compare verse 4 (<i>the assembly said that they would do so</i>), also 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr> 2, 4. Similarly in <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 2
    the king addresses the elders as <i>My brethren</i>. Doubtless the Chronicler had in mind Deuteronomy <abbr

In Samuel the command is to assail the rear of the enemy, in Chronicles to avoid the rear (which was perhaps protected by a rear-guard) and to attack (presumably) the flank.

    There is no parallel in Samuel to this section.</p>
  <p>
    In 2 Samuel <abbr title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 12 the reason given for the renewal of David’s attempt to bring the Ark to Jerusalem is the report of the blessing which was said to have befallen Obed-edom, in whose house the Ark had been left. The Chronicler is not ignorant of this tradition since he refers to it incidentally in <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 14,
    but it would be very far from his sense of the fitness of things to adduce it as the motive for David’s action. On the contrary he declares in this section that David was prompted by a realisation that the ill-success of the first attempt was due to failure to observe the regulations of the Levitical Law. Full attention now being given to the prescribed ritual, David succeeds in his pious purpose.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>

      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 39).</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ²Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the <span

  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ³And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the <span

    This unusual sixfold division, and the smallness of the numbers of Levites have been taken as indicating that the whole passage <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15
    is drawn by the Chronicler from an earlier source, but the argument is not convincing. “The text does not imply that Elizaphan, Hebron, and Uzziel were coordinated with Kohath, Gershom, and Merari”; and the small numbers are accounted for by the view that only selected Levites were chosen for the task (so Curtis, <i>Chronicles</i>, <abbr

  <p>
    <b>5.</b> <i>the sons of Kohath; Uriel</i>] Kohath had four sons (Exodus <abbr

    Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Here the descendants of Amram (exclusive of the priests, the Aaronites) represented by Uriel head the list (verse 5), and the descendants of Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel appear in verses 8, 9, 10 respectively. <i>Elizaphan</i> (verse 8) either stands for the <i>Izhar</i> of Exodus <abbr

    or is the name of some prominent descendant of Izhar after whom the whole family was named. He is mentioned again in 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 13.
    As regards number the Kohathites were 512 against 350 of the sons of Merari and the sons of Gershom combined. In <abbr

    This chapter like the last is taken from 2 Samuel with a few omissions and variations. The Chronicler paraphrases (verses 1, 17), omits (verse 2), has a different reading (verses 4, 8, 10, 12). In some cases the better reading is in Chronicles.</p>
  <p>
    The campaigns (except perhaps that against Moab) seem to be narrated in chronological order. David first makes sure of his most pressing enemy the Philistines (verse 1); then feeling safe towards the south-west he turns towards the north-east secure on the Euphrates (but see note verse 3) a station (valuable for trade) held by the Syrians of Zobah (verse 3); the Syrians of Damascus fearing to be excluded from the River by David’s success come to the help of their kinsmen (verse 5); lastly the Edomites, urged perhaps by the Syrians to make a diversion in their favour and thinking it safe to attack Judah during the absence of David, join in the war, but are signally defeated by a detachment under Joab and Abishai (verse 12).</p>
  <p>
    The war with Moab (verse 2) is surprising, if it took place at an early date in David’s reign, for he seems to have been on specially friendly terms with the king of Moab during his exile; compare 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 3, 4

  <p>

      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr>),
    because he has ignored the story of David’s relations with Saul. Further the Court History of David which occupies an important place in 2 Samuel is passed over altogether in Chronicles Consequently the shameful episode of Bath-sheba, and the rebellion of Absalom vanish from the account of David. It is obvious how greatly the presentation of David’s life and character is affected by these omissions. Yet from his point of view the Chronicler is right in passing these matters by in silence. He was concerned to present David essentially as the founder of the religious life of Israel as a kingdom and of the Temple as an institution of religion.</p>

    ¹And it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>

    <b>1.</b> <i>after this</i>] The war with Ammon has already been referred to by anticipation in <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 11.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Nahash</i>] Probably the Nahash mentioned in 1 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 1.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Ammon</i>] The Ammonites were a kindred race to the Hebrews, being descended according to tradition from Lot, the nephew of Abraham; compare Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 19.
    The two Ammonite names here given are pure Hebrew, <i>Nahash</i> (= “Serpent”) and <i>Hanun</i> (= “Favoured, <i>Fortunatus</i>”); the Ammonite language, like the Moabite, was doubtless very similar to Hebrew.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ²And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>2.</b> <i>sent messengers to comfort him</i>] A customary act of international courtesy; compare 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 12.
    Its breach was resented. Thus in the Tell el-Amarna letters (<abbr
      title="letter 10">x.</abbr> <abbr
      title="line 16">16</abbr>)
    the king of Kardunias writes, “Should not my brother (<abbr

      title="page">p.</abbr> 23).</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00" id="b122">
    ³But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>

  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴So Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>shaved them</i>] 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 4,

      title="chapter 50">l.</abbr> 6.</p>

      title="the Second">II</abbr>,
    king of Assyria, now preserved in the British Museum) as wearing robes reaching to the feet; Hanun reduced ambassadors to the level of captives; compare Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 4.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁵Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>5.</b> <i>Tarry at Jericho</i>] Thus (1) the feelings of the ambassadors would be spared, (2) the insult would be less widely known until it had been avenged.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁶And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Aram-maacah, and out of Zobah.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>6.</b> <i>a thousand talents of silver</i>] A very large sum; for a hundred talents Amaziah hired a hundred thousand men (2 Chronicles <abbr

    <i>Mesopotamia</i>] Hebrew “Aram (Syria) of the two rivers” (compare Genesis <abbr

    Revised Version margin), <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    probably the land between the Euphrates and the Chaboras. The Greeks used the term <i>Mesopotamia</i> of a wider district, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    of the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris. This mention of Mesopotamia is probably premature, for in verse 16
    the summons of Syrians from beyond the Euphrates is spoken of as a new thing. The corresponding expression in 2 Samuel <abbr

    ¹⁰Now when Joab saw that the battle<a

    Comparison of these verses with the account given in Samuel
    discloses not a few interesting divergences, the more important of which are pointed out in the notes below (see especially the notes on verses 1, 6, 25). In general it may be said that the account in Chronicles curtails any features reflecting discredit on David and expands such as do him honour. Some scholars consider that the changes are of such a character that they may all be due directly to the Chronicler, but others see in them motives so various as to suggest the opinion that the Chronicler’s source is not Samuel but an intermediate source. There may be a measure of truth in both contentions. So famous a tale may well have been recounted with modifications in the telling to suit the later idealisation of David. The Chronicler may therefore have been working from the text of Samuel, but some of the changes he introduced may have been generally current, and for these he is in a sense not <i>immediately</i> responsible, although of course all were more or less in accordance with his taste.</p>
  <p>
    The subject of the present section (David’s numbering of the people and the plague which followed) is interesting in itself, quite apart from the comparison with Samuel Why was the census considered a sin? Various replies may be made. (1) Because the pride of David and the ambitions <a id="b128"></a>which the census might promote revealed a transference of trust from God to self, from spirit to numbers, from justice to power. This view accords with our modern moralistic standpoint, but other considerations call for mention. (2) Because, unlike the two numberings in the wilderness (Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16, <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 39, <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>65),
    it was not made by Divine command (compare verse 1, note).
    This thought may well have been present in the mind of the Chronicler. To it we may add (3) the popular dread of the census as a sinister and unlucky act. The ground of this dread was no doubt mainly practical, being due to the fear that the records might be used for purposes of fresh taxation or more stringent war-levies, but it may have its roots in an instinct, handed down from the thoughts of primitive ages, when written records were an uncanny mystery. Thus S. I. Curtiss, <i>Primitive Semitic Religion To-day</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 69,
    remarks that the persistence of this fear among modern Semites is partially chargeable for the lack of correct statistics as to the population of Oriental towns. Frazer (in <i>Anthropological Essays to E. B. Tylor</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 174)
    refers to the dread of enumeration felt by the Lapps and by a West African tribe.</p>

    the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them.” The change is significant of the late date of Chronicles In an earlier stage of Hebrew thought human sin and folly are at times naïvely ascribed to the agency of God, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    “He hardens Pharaoh’s heart” (Exodus <abbr

      lang="la">quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.</span>”
    At a later date the instigation of some subordinate “evil” spirit was adduced, <abbr

      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 20<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>24;
    and eventually this spirit of temptation was expressly termed “The Satan” or “Satan,” <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    “The Adversary.” He was then regarded as a hostile spiritual being, the opposite of a <i>guardian</i> angel such as the Michael of Daniel <abbr

    may be a gloss. If so, then the 200,000 less in Chronicles (1,300,000 in Samuel; 1,100,000 in Chronicles, where <i>Israel</i> would as so often denote both Israel and Judah) might well be explained as an allowance for the exclusion of Levi and Benjamin (see verse 6).</p>

    <i>bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver</i>. The huge discrepancy here between Chronicles and Samuel
    is noteworthy. If the price in Samuel, 50 shekels of silver for threshing-floor and oxen, seems somewhat small (compared with the 400 shekels paid by Abraham for the cave of Machpelah, Genesis <abbr

    the 600 shekels of <i>gold</i> in Chronicles is extravagantly large. It is accounted for by the fact that the Chronicler regarded the transaction, not as the acquisition merely of the site for the altar but of the area on which the Temple was afterwards built (see verse 22). No sum could well seem too large for the purchase of ground destined to be so holy. The figure 600 may have been chosen on the ground that it was equal to a payment of 50 shekels for each tribe.</p>

The Chronicler’s desire to show only the idealistic aspect of David’s life has frequently been pointed out.

    <span class="smcap">David’s Preparations for Building the Temple.
        His charge to Solomon and to the Princes.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    It is of course quite probable that preparations for a Temple were begun in David’s time, but the picture given in this chapter must not be taken as historically true, the material being of a general character such as the imagination could readily supply, and the figures mentioned in verse 14 being impossibly exaggerated. The chapter in fact is the
    <a id="b134"></a>outcome of the Chronicler’s zealous but uncritical mind working in the belief that, not Solomon, but the pious David was the “moving spirit in the great enterprise.” As Moses led Israel to Jordan’s brink, so David (he thought) must stop short only at the actual building of the Temple.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ²And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. ³And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight;</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>2.</b> <i>the strangers</i>] Compare 2 Chronicles <abbr

      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9.
    Hewing of stone was regarded as task-work unfit for free men. This verse is simply an anticipation of the preparations recorded in Solomon’s reign: see 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 1, 17.</p>
  <p>
    <i>wrought stones</i>] All the stone used for the building of the Temple was previously cut to the right size; compare 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 7.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">

    ⁶Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the <span

    <b>5.</b> <i>exceeding magnifical</i>] The Temple took seven years in building, and it was richly overlaid with gold, but its proportions were small, <abbr

      title="feet">ft.</abbr> × 30 <abbr

    These small proportions, are not surprising, for the Temple itself required only to be big enough to hold its furniture. The courts, however, were of large extent, that they might afford room for worshippers at the times of the great feasts.</p>
  <p>
    Note the archaic <i>magnifical</i> = <i>splendid</i>, <i>stately</i> (magnificent). It is found of course in the Authorized Version (1611), and also in the Geneva Bible (1560); compare Starkey, <i>England</i>, <abbr

      title="23">xxiii.</abbr> 1
    intimates the appointment of Solomon and the assembling by royal command of the princes, priests, and Levites of Israel. The topics thus suggested are then, after the prevailing fashion of Chronicles,
    treated in the reverse order; first the Levites, chapter <abbr
      title="23">xxiii.</abbr>; then the priests, <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr>
    (followed by the <a id="b137"></a>singers, <abbr

    then the civil and military orders. chapters <abbr

    ²And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. ³And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>3.</b> <i>the Levites were numbered from thirty years</i>] Two accounts are here given of the organisation of the Levites. According to the first the Levites were admitted to service at thirty years of age; verse 3; compare Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 3, 23, 30,
    where the period from thirty to fifty is fixed as the period for service. According to the second account (verses 24<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>27)
    the Levites were taken from twenty years old and upwards; this was apparently the later custom; compare 2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 31">xxxi.</abbr> 17; Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 8.
    The discrepancy probably arises from an actual variation in practice. The original age of admission for Levites was probably thirty, but owing to the scarcity of their numbers it seems to have been necessary to reduce the limit of age to twenty. But see also the note on <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 51 <abbr

  <p>
    <i>thirty and eight thousand</i>] Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 39 gives 22,000, and Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 26">xxvi.</abbr> 62,
    23,000, as the number of male Levites from a month old and upwards in the time of Moses.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    and six thousand were officers and judges:</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>twenty and four thousand</i>] These were divided into courses (verse 6), serving by turn, apparently twenty-four in number, consisting each of a thousand men. See, however, the note on verses 6<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23 below.</p>
  <p>
    <i>to oversee the work</i>] It is true that there were some Temple servants subordinate to the Levites—see note on the <i>Nethinim</i>, <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 2.
    But the duty of the Levites was to perform the work of the Temple (as is said <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    in verses 24, 28), not to act as overseers of the work of others. It is therefore to be inferred that the “work” spoken of here and in verse 5 is not the routine duties of the Temple but the work of its construction. Adding the Levites of verse 4 to the officers, doorkeepers, and musicians of verse 5, we have a total of 38,000 overseers: that the number is incredibly large is no objection in Chronicles.</p>
  <p>
    <i>officers and judges</i>] Compare 2 Chronicles <abbr

    <b>24.</b> <i>from twenty years old and upward</i>] The striking divergence between this verse and verse 3, where <i>thirty</i> is given as the minimum age for service as a Levite, has given rise to much discussion—see the note to verse 3. No doubt the concluding remarks of that note are true historically: a change in the inferior age limit of the Levites <i>did</i> take place at some time on account of the need for larger numbers in office. But neither that fact, nor the theory (which is hardly borne out by other considerations) that the Chronicler has used varying traditions from two different sources, suffices to explain why he left the evident contradiction in his narrative. The desirability of explaining this circumstance strongly favours the view urged by Curtis, that in verses 3 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    the Chronicler meant to describe the Levitical organisation during and for the purpose of the preparation and erection of the Temple, whilst verses 24 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    relate to the period when the Temple was completed and the duties of the Levites, being both more numerous and at the same time of a more mechanical nature, might well seem to call for an increase in the number of those officiating. When the reduction of the age limit to <i>twenty</i> actually took place is of course immaterial; but it is quite in keeping with the manner of the Chronicler that he should thus carry both arrangements back to the time of David.</p>

    The Chronicler displays so much interest in the liturgical worship of the Temple that it is very probable that he was himself a member of the musical guilds. There is no reason to question the importance of the musicians in the Temple worship of the late post-exilic period. But the development of their organisation and duties was certainly a gradual process, and did not, as the Chronicler here represents, spring into being, full-grown, in the days of David. Three classes—the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun (= Ethan) had come to be clearly recognised. They are here regarded as divided into twenty-four courses (like the Levites and Priests), but that this even in the Chronicler’s time represents not an actuality but an ideal is suggested by the artificial character of the names which conclude the list—see verse 4, note on <i>Hananiah</i>.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹Moreover David and the captains of the host separated for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of them that did the work according to their service was:</p>

    What explanation can be offered of this startling fact? It may be that the names are wholly artificial, invented by the Chronicler to fill out the desired twenty-four courses (see the head-note above), but the <a id="b147"></a>device is clumsy and the Chronicler was not likely to be bankrupt for names.

    it is said that in the census which God commanded Moses to take in the wilderness only those above twenty years old were to be numbered, and a chief from each tribe was appointed to assist Moses in the task of numeration. The Chronicler in this section wishes to say that, though David erred in taking the census unbidden by Jehovah, he at least conformed to the principles of the Law in carrying out his project: those under 20 years of age were not counted, and the princes just enumerated may be supposed to correspond to the chiefs who assisted Moses.</p>

    and many scholars in consequence prefer to follow the margin
    and render <b>Jonathan, David’s brother’s son</b>. Curtis renders <b>David’s lover</b>, taking the reference to be to Jonathan, Saul’s son, who as the friend of David’s youth might be spoken of as his first “counsellor.” This view seems improbable but is not impossible, despite the phrase “<i>and a scribe</i>” which could not possibly be said of Saul’s warrior son. There is some evidence that those words are a gloss, and it is true that the list is not one of living men only (compare Ahithophel), whilst finally the Chronicler might well be tempted to drag in an allusion to a relationship so well-known and so creditable to David.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    The glorious reign now reaches a fitting climax. David summons the assembly of all the princes and commanders of Israel, and, in the presence of the heir to the throne, addresses them in a final oration. He recounts his Divine election and rule over Israel and the promise that the same Divine Power will be with Solomon his son (<abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>10).
    Then, handing over to Solomon the inspired plans for the Temple (11<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>21),
    and briefly describing the treasures he has amassed for its enrichment (<abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>5)
    he appeals to the liberality of the people and is met by a magnificent response (6<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9).
    Finally, in a prayer of fine humility and faith (10<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>20),
    he commends his son and his people to the eternal and all-powerful God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. How immense the contrast between this and the pathetically real picture of the closing days of David portrayed in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr>, <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11!
    There the dying monarch is seen, exhausted in mind and body, surrounded by the intrigues of an Eastern palace. With a last flicker of his strength, he rouses himself to secure the succession of Solomon by firm but ruthless orders against the leaders of the opposing faction. Whilst the narrative in Kings is indispensable to us in preserving some record of the actual history of the last days of David, Chronicles is also of great value in its own way as a religious interpretation of history (Introduction <abbr
      title="pages Roman Numerals 53, 55">pp. <a
      href="#a053">liii</a>, lv</abbr>).
    Rightly understood, this farewell speech is in many respects a noble and inspiring passage of Scripture: so <i>ought</i> a perfect reign to end. Here David dies, leaving his country peaceful, powerful, and contented. He dies believing that his people’s true prosperity is in its zeal for the worship of God; and for that end, with the popular approval, he has made marvellous preparation. And lastly he dies, in no vain-glorious spirit, but conscious of the littleness of man and the majesty of God, and in humble dependence on the continuance of Grace.</p>

    <b>royal majesty which was not on any king more than on him in Israel</b>.</p>
  <p id="b168">
    In Chronicles the character of Solomon is idealised somewhat in the same fashion as that of David. He is depicted as the monarch who attained the ideal of inspired wisdom and of royal splendour, and whose piety was supremely manifested in the privilege permitted him of building and dedicating the Temple. In this last fact the Chronicler doubtless felt that Solomon had a claim to the praises of posterity which completely outweighed any sinister traits of his character revealed in Kings. Elsewhere he refers to Solomon’s failings in order to point a moral; “Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin by these things?... Even him did strange women cause to sin” (Nehemiah <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 26).
    But here, where he relates his reign as a whole, the darker aspects—his many wives and his tolerance of their idolatrous worship—are passed over and only the king’s zeal for Jehovah and the glories of Israel in his day are allowed to appear.</p>

    The passage in Kings naïvely states that Solomon offered his sacrifice at Gibeon (6 miles north-west of Jerusalem) <i>because that was the great high place</i>. The Chronicler regarded the worship of the high-places as an illegal act, and sought to justify Solomon’s action in this undeniable instance by the theory that the tent of meeting and the brasen altar (verse 5) were at the high-place of Gibeon (see the head-note to 1 Chronicles <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>16.</b> <i>And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt</i>] Egypt is an agricultural not a pastoral country; it lacks the broad plains suitable for the rearing of large numbers of horses. But the Arabs of the Sinai peninsula stood in close political and mercantile relations with Egypt, and it may be that though the horses were raised in Arabia and Central Asia they passed through Egyptian hands (Barnes on 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 28).
    It is possible, however, that the reading <i>Egypt</i> is a mistake—see the following note.</p>
  <p>
    <i>in droves, each drove at a price</i>] The word “droves” is incorrectly translated “linen yarn” in the Authorized Version The rendering <i>droves</i> is just possible; but it is probable that, on the basis of some versions, we should read <b>from Ku‘i</b> (<i>or</i> <b>Kuë</b>) <b>at a price</b>. <i>Kuë</i> is a district mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions and generally identified with Cilicia. It is further proposed that, instead of <i>Egypt</i> (Hebrew <i>Miṣraim</i>), we should read <i>Muṣri</i>, a name applied (1) to Egypt, and (2) extended beyond it to the area south of Palestine, and (3) also denoting a district in north Syria, south of the Taurus, and named in Assyrian inscriptions. In this case, in connection with <i>Kuë</i>, we should identify it with the last mentioned.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ¹⁷And they fetched up, and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p>

  <p>
    <i>Hittites</i>] Settlements of Hittites seem to have existed here and there in Canaan, but in the regions north-east of Syria they formed a powerful state, able for many centuries to contend on equal terms with the Assyrians and Egyptians. Their chief cities were Carchemish on the Euphrates and Kadesh on the Orontes. They were subdued in the eighth century by the Assyrians.</p>

    The 30,000 Israelites were subject to a corvée of one month in every three, the 150,000 aliens were presumably supposed to have been continuously engaged on the work. The Chronicler makes no mention of the levy of 30,000 Israelites, recorded in Kings, for no doubt he thought it unfitting that compulsory labour should be laid on the Israelites themselves. On the other hand he holds that the 150,000 were <i>all</i> aliens (see verses 17, 18), whereas the writer in Kings, not having that scruple before his mind, does not make any such sweeping assertion (compare, however, 1 Kings <abbr

    seems to have given rise to the idea that in early times the cubit was a somewhat longer measure, and that may be what the Chronicler intended by the present phrase “cubits after the first (or <i>former</i>) measure.” Exact measurements on the site of the Temple have now demonstrated that about 17½ inches was at all times the standard length of the cubit (see <i>Palestine Exploration Fund Statement</i> October, 1915, <abbr

    The figures were therefore emblematic of the presence of Jehovah.</p>
  <p>
    The graving of the cherubim was not felt to be a breach of the Second Commandment, for they were not put up to “bow down to” or to “serve.”</p>

    In Solomon’s Temple these twin columns may have been conventional imitations of the prevailing type of temple building, but it is rather to be supposed that there also they were considered to be symbolic of the presence of God, and were developments of the ancient stone pillars (<i>maṣṣeboth</i>) which were a constant feature at Semitic shrines and had originally been regarded as the abode of the Deity.</p>

    It is impossible therefore to say whether the Chronicler derives the measurements he here gives from a text of Kings which did contain a description of the brasen altar, or from the altar of the Temple of his own period. The latter is more probable. Some scholars consider it possible that at first Solomon’s Temple contained no artificial altar, the sacrifices being offered on the great natural rock which is now covered by the famous building popularly known as the Mosque of Omar (properly “The Dome of the Rock”).</p>

    and, originally at least, is likely to have had religious significance, as a symbol of Jehovah’s power over the seas and the rain, or over the primeval Deep upon which His might was exercised in the creation of the world (Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr>; Psalms <abbr

  <p>
    <i>ten cubits from brim to brim ... and a line of thirty cubits compassed it</i>] The mathematical inaccuracy in the measurements here given—10 in diameter, 30 in circumference—has often been pointed out. But the literal Hebrew is “ten <i>with</i> the cubit ... and thirty <i>with</i> the cubit,” and F. C. Burkitt in a communication to the <i>Cambridge Review</i> for May 13, 1914 offers an interesting vindication of the phrase. He writes “... What the verse says about the circumference of the ‘sea’ is that they stretched a string round it, and when they laid the string out flat they had to go thirty times with the cubit, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    a man had to put his elbow down thirty times before he got to the end.” [The distance from the point of the elbow to the tip of the longest finger is 1 cubit.] “No doubt the last time he put his elbow down the string came short: in other words, the ‘sea’ was nine-and-a-bittock across and twenty-nine-and-a-bittock round. As a matter of fact, if a circle be 9 <abbr

    <b>6.</b> <i>the sea was for the priests to wash in</i>] See, however, the note on verse 2 above regarding its probable significance in early times. For this, the Chronicler’s view of its purpose (as also that of the lavers), compare Exodus <abbr

    the question arises whether the <i>ten</i> ever had historical reality, or were simply a fiction of tradition. The reference to candlesticks of gold and of silver in 1 Chronicles <abbr

    does not help us, for it depends on the same evidence, sound or unsound, which the Chronicler had for the present passage. Some scholars feel that there must be some ground for the statement; but no positive conclusion is yet possible.</p>

    but the parallel passage (1 Kings <abbr

    has “the table” (<i>singular</i>), and elsewhere both in Chronicles and in the rest of the Old Testament one table only is assigned to the shewbread (2 Chronicles <abbr

      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 18).
    Probably therefore the ten tables here mentioned were <i>not</i> for the shewbread, although the Chronicler may have thought so. The same uncertainty attaches to this tradition of ten tables as to that of the ten candlesticks (see previous note); and it is held by some that these tables were for the support of the candlesticks.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>9.</b> <i>the court of the priests, and the great court</i>] The phrases reflect the conditions of the second Temple with which the Chronicler was familiar, when the inner court was confined to the use of the priests, the outer one being for the people. Solomon’s Temple, strictly speaking, had only <i>one</i> court, for in “the other court” stood Solomon’s house (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 8).
    This “other court” seems to be called the “middle court” (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 4,
    margin), and the “upper court” (Jeremiah <abbr
      title="chapter 36">xxxvi.</abbr> 10).
    The “great court” (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 12)
    was perhaps a third court containing not <a id="b184"></a>only the king’s house, but all the royal buildings as well. The Hebrew word for “court” in all the above passages is <i>ḥāṣēr</i>, but here the “court (<i>ḥāṣēr</i>) of the priests” is distinguished from a court called the “great court” (Hebrew “great <i>‘azārāh</i>”). Perhaps the Chronicler wishes to make the same distinction when he says that Solomon’s great prayer was offered (<abbr

  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>the Levites took up the ark</i>] According to 1 Kings the <i>priests</i> performed this duty. In the days of David and Solomon all Levites were possible priests, Levi being the name of the priestly clan and not of a lower order of priests. At a later period the Levites were regarded as a class subordinate to the priests, having duties distinct from those of the priests—<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    the task of bearing the tabernacle and all its furniture (see Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 50, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>).
    The Chronicler believing that this distinction had been in force from the time of Moses onwards “corrects” the text of Kings by changing “priests” into “Levites”: compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 2, 12, 13.

    ⁵And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these did the priests the Levites bring up. ⁶And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>5.</b> <i>the tent of meeting</i>] <abbr

      title="and following">f.</abbr>).
    The parallel statement in Kings comes not from the early sources but from the hand of a late reviser.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the priests the Levites</i>] here the older phrase, which does not indicate a distinction between Priests and Levites, has been allowed to stand, perhaps “because certain utensils might well have been borne by the priests” (so Curtis), or possibly through slight carelessness on the Chronicler’s part. The parallel in Kings has “the priests <i>and</i> the Levites.”</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁷And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the <span

      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 3, 9 = 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 3, 9),
    Hamath apparently being north of Zobah. It is probable however that <i>Hamath</i> as the name of a city belonged to more than one place, and Hamath-zobah may be a southern namesake of the well-known Hamath the great (Amos <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 2).</p>
  <p>
    <i>prevailed against it</i>] No mention of this campaign is made elsewhere. It may be a genuine tradition preserved only in Chronicles.
    On the other hand, this statement and the reference to the store-cities <i>built in Hamath</i> (verse 4) may be due to nothing except the mention of <i>Tadmor in the wilderness</i> (itself an error, see following note). If Solomon built far-off Tadmor, then (the Chronicler thinks) he must also have subdued the region of Hamath.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>Tadmor in the wilderness</i>] Palmyra (Bädeker, <i>Palestine</i>⁵, <abbr

      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span> 34,
    when it was threatened with attack by Mark Antony. This silence of history for a thousand years casts a doubt on the belief that Tadmor (Palmyra) is as old as the time of Solomon, and the doubt is strengthened by a reference to the parallel passage (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 18),
    for there (1) the text (<i>Kethīb</i>) has “Tamar,” with “Tadmor” as marginal reading (<i>Ḳerī</i>), and (2) Tamar (Tadmor) is associated with Gezer, Beth-horon, and Baalath, cities either in Judah or on its borders. Probably therefore the marginal reading “Tadmor” in 1 Kings is due to the influence of 2 Chronicles, and the text of 1 Kings
    (“Tamar”) is correct. The city built by Solomon was a Tamar in the south of Judah.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">

      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>

If so, the actual warriors represented by 180 such “thousands” would be about 30,000, a very large number for so small a state, yet not impossible. But, however that may be for the early days, there is little or no doubt that the Chronicler understood the word in its strict sense: a literal thousand. See the note on <abbr

    while the remaining thirteen were in Judah. Compare verse 5.</p>

    Benjamin, in reality, belonged to the Northern Kingdom until, after the fall of Samaria, its territory was included in the Judean kingdom (see 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 20).
    Later, the idea prevailed that it had been one with the Southern Kingdom from the beginning—as appears here, and apparently in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 31.
    At any rate the phrase, Judah and Benjamin, came to be used as a general expression denoting the Southern Kingdom. How long any sense of its partial inaccuracy remained is uncertain.</p>

    <i>Jehovah</i>). Jeroboam did not abandon the worship of Jehovah, although later generations thought so and could not conceive that the famous “calves wherewith he made Israel to sin” were images symbolic of Jehovah. The Chronicler regards him as having lapsed into gross idolatry (see verse 15)
    and as having ejected all the Levites from his kingdom. A less stringent opinion as to his treatment of the priests of Jehovah is expressed in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 31, <abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 33
    where it is not said that Jeroboam rejected the tribe of Levi, but only that he allowed men of any tribe to become priests; “he ... made priests from among all the people” (Revised Version). Comparison of Kings and Chronicles is here very valuable as an illustration of the care with which the history in Chronicles has been adapted to indicate that the Northern Kingdom was wholly wicked and apostate from the start. The Chronicler’s hostility
    <a id="b213"></a>to the North is really directed against the Samaritans: see Introduction <a

    ¹³So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>13.</b> <i>strengthened himself</i>] See note on <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 1.
    The immediate reference is to a recovery of strength after the departure of Shishak; the further reference is to <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 5.</p>
  <p>
    <i>forty and one years old ... and he reigned seventeen years</i>] So read both the Hebrew and <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> here and in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 21,
    but in the additional passage which follows 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 24 in <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    (B, not A) we read, <i>sixteen</i> <a id="b217"></a><i>years old ... and twelve years he reigned</i>. No importance however can be attached to this variation, for the passage which contains it is plainly midrashic in character.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the city which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> had chosen</i>] Though the Ten Tribes were lost to the house of David, the Lord kept his oath to David by securing to his seed the possession of the one holy city of Israel.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ¹⁴And he did that which was evil, because he set not his heart to seek the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>14.</b> <i>he set not his heart</i>] The phrase implies <i>steady purpose</i>. The Chronicler concludes that Rehoboam must be classed as a king who was good but not entirely so. The considerations which chiefly influenced him in determining the character of this reign were perhaps two: on the one hand the invasion of Shishak was felt to be a fixed point, a disaster only to be accounted for in the Chronicler’s view by <i>some</i> falling away from assiduous worship of Jehovah; and on the other hand it seemed incredible that the second direct descendant of David on the throne of Israel should have been seriously corrupt. The situation was met by representing Rehoboam as having been three years faithful (and therefore prosperous), and one year faithless (and therefore assailed by Shishak in the fifth year). The favourable aspect of his reign was further emphasised by the statement of verse 16, and by the suppression of the three damaging passages in Kings, referred to in the head-note to <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 5<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23.
    It is very obvious that the resultant picture of the king is much less true to historical reality than the account in Kings; but it serves excellently to illustrate the Chronicler’s contention that virtue prospers and vice is punished. And once more we may insist that the value of this writer for us lies supremely in the energy and the conviction with which he seeks to drive home this great moral and spiritual belief.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">

    And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. ¹⁶And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

      title="and following">f.</abbr>),
    passages which like the present are nowhere else recorded, and are essentially unhistorical. No reliance can be placed on the high numbers of the opposing armies (verse 3), on the pious speech ascribed to king Abijah which neatly and forcibly expresses the ecclesiastical view of schismatic Israel held by the Chronicler and his school (verses 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>12),
    or on the appalling carnage wrought in the Israelite army (verse 17). The tale, in fact, is of a markedly midrashic character, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    a narrative intended to edify and not to be treated as serious history. But in all such cases it is fair to distinguish between the form and the substance: at least the bare substance of the tale. Thus in the present instance the judgement stated above does not preclude the possibility that war took place between Abijah and Jeroboam, and that the former gained a useful success over the more powerful Northern Kingdom. The absence from Kings of any mention of such victory is a serious objection; but it is not fatal, unless we take the view—objected to in the Introduction <a
      href="#a029">§ 5</a>—that
    the Chronicler had absolutely no sources, oral or written, of the faintest value for pre-exilic days apart from the canonical writings. Yet it must be admitted that it would be not unnatural to the workings of the Chronicler’s mind to infer that some signal success must have rewarded so near a descendant of David if only to compensate in part for Rehoboam’s disastrous reign and at any rate to punish the glaring iniquity of a schismatic and idolatrous Israel. Judging from the brief account of Abijah in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>7,
    we may conclude that the continued hostility between North and South was a fact, but that it is extremely improbable there was a reliable tradition (if any at all) regarding a <i>great</i> Judean victory in his reign: see note on <i>Zemaraim</i> below.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00" id="b219">
    ³And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valour.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>3.</b> <i>four hundred thousand ... eight hundred thousand</i>] The numbers are of course vastly in excess of any historic possibility; compare the notes on <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 1, <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 8, and especially that on <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 14.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel;</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>Abijah stood up</i>] Abijah attempts conference before beginning civil war, not simply because his was the weaker side numerically but because he had a telling appeal to make to the revolted tribes (verses 8, 12). Jeroboam breaks off the conference after using it to cover his stratagem (verse 13).</p>
  <p>
    <i>Zemaraim</i>] A Zemaraim is mentioned in Joshua <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 22
    as one of the cities of <i>Benjamin</i>, whereas here Mount Zemaraim is assigned to <i>Ephraim</i>. The natural inference is that the battle took place on the border of the two kingdoms. The tradition that a battle took place here between North and South, and perhaps between Abijah and Jeroboam, may be correct.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁵ought ye not to know that the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? ⁶Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>5.</b> <i>a covenant of salt</i>] Salt was necessary for the efficacy of a sacrifice (Leviticus <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr> 13),
    so that <i>Covenant of salt</i> became a phrase for a <i>sure</i> covenant (Numbers <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 19).
    The sacredness of the bond which is acknowledged among the Arabs between two persons who have “eaten salt” together as host and guest is common knowledge. It is not, however, necessary that salt should be taken; any food, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    milk, will serve (W. R. Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 270).</p>

    where it is said that Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign. It is possible, however, that the word is used metaphorically to describe one who was <i>young</i> (as indeed his conduct showed) in experience of government; so Solomon (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 7)
    calls himself a <i>little child</i>, by which he meant simply to express his consciousness of the smallness of his own ability when compared with the greatness of the task which lay before him, compare 1 Chronicles <abbr

    to ordain Aaron and his sons priests by three ceremonies: (1) by anointing them, (2) by filling their hands, <abbr

    by presenting them with victims upon which they laid their hands, (3) by hallowing them, <abbr

  <p>

  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ¹⁵Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. ¹⁶And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand.</p>

    <b>17.</b> The Chronicler has little or no interest in military matters as such, and is heedless of probability so far as the numbers he mentions are concerned. They must be sufficiently immense to enhance the power of Jehovah and to convey the impression that the days of old were mighty days.

    and received favour from Jehovah only on account of the merits of David.

    In Kings the reign of Asa is reviewed with entire approval, according to Chronicles his conduct was marred only by the lack of faith manifested in his reliance on the king of Syria (see <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>10),
    and in his recourse to physicians at the close of his reign (<abbr

  <p class="scripture">
    ¹So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his days the land was quiet ten years. ²And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span> his God:</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>1.</b> <i>ten years</i>] These <i>ten</i> years of rest are naturally to be assigned to the beginning of Asa’s reign; later on there was a rest of <i>twenty</i> years (compare <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 10 with <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 19).
    The number <i>ten</i> here makes a discrepancy with 1 Kings,
    for Baasha became king of Israel in the <i>third</i> year of Asa (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 28, 33),
    and “there was war between Asa and Baasha all their days” (1 Kings <abbr

    he is said to have put away the sodomites, and all the idols that his fathers had made; and also “the abominable image” which Maacah, his mother, had made. These remarks are here ignored by the Chronicler, probably because they would be out of harmony with the comparatively pious character he has ascribed to Asa’s predecessors, Rehoboam and Abijah. They are given, however, in <abbr

    <i>the strange altars</i>] <abbr title="that is">i.e.</abbr> altars belonging to gods other than Jehovah.</p>

    where it is said “But the high places were not taken away: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    all his days.” This remarkable contrast affords a vivid illustration of the different standpoints of Kings and Chronicles
    In Kings the removal of the high-places is the great reform of later days effected by Hezekiah (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 4, 22),
    by Josiah (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 8).
    To the Chronicler, who believed that the law centralising the worship of Jehovah in Jerusalem was in force from the Mosaic age, the abolition of the high-places was felt to be a minimum <a id="b224"></a>of reform and must surely have been carried out by any king with a claim to piety.

    <i>the pillars</i>] <abbr title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr> <span
      class="fnt_serif" lang="grc">τὰς στήλας</span>.
    The “pillar” or “obelisk,” Hebrew <i>Maṣṣēbāh</i>, was a monolith standing by an altar as a symbol of the god worshipped at the altar. In later days an image took the place of the pillar, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    the mere symbol was succeeded by the likeness of the god. (W. R. Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites²</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 203 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>,
    and for illustrations of those recently discovered at Gezer see Macalister, <i>Bible Side-lights</i>, or Driver, <i>Modern Research as illustrating the Bible</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 63.)</p>
  <p>
    <i>and hewed down the Asherim</i>] An <i>Ashērah</i> (plural <i>Ashērim</i> and <i>Ashēroth</i>) was a wooden pole planted beside an altar as the symbol of a deity. It appears to have been a survival of tree-worship, as the <i>Maṣṣēbāh</i> was a survival of stone-worship. The <i>Ashērah</i> of itself did not represent any particular deity, but it could be carved to bear the symbol of any special god or goddess, <abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    of Ashtarte. (W. R. Smith, <i>Religion of the Semites</i>², <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 186 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    Probably the term <i>Ashērah</i> was used in reference to the living sacred trees, which are still common in Palestine: see the present writer’s edition of the Mishna tractate, <i>‘Aboda Zara</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 60 <abbr

      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 8, <abbr
      title="chapter 27">xxvii.</abbr> 9. The Hebrew
    word (“ḥamman”) is of uncertain meaning and the supposed connection with <i>heat</i> or the <i>sun</i> is unsatisfactory. On the whole the evidence points to the conclusion that the “ḥamman” was a stone pillar associated with the altar, and much the same as the “Maṣṣēbāh,” the difference perhaps being that the former was artificially shaped, the latter was of natural stone (see article <i>Baal</i> in Hastings’ <i>Dictionary of Religion and Ethics</i>, <abbr

      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 17<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>22,
    it appears that there was a strong and probably a reliable tradition ascribing to Asa activity in building defensive townships in Judah. It is likely that the present verses with their vague reference to strongly built cities with no mention of their number or names are only an expansion of the more precise references in <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 6.
    The Chronicler has assigned the narrative given in <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>6
    (the war with Baasha) to the close of Asa’s reign (for reasons noted under <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 1),
    and he obviously <i>wanted</i> something to occupy the ten years of peace with which—according to his story—the reign of Asa opened. This is conveniently found in a general allusion to building and fortification.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00" id="b225">
    ⁶And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years; because the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    had given him rest. ⁷For he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    our God; we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. ⁸And Asa had an army that bare bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>

    The Chronicler divides Asa’s army into the heavy-armed men belonging to Judah and the light-armed bowmen belonging to Benjamin. Asa apparently had no chariots. “Bucklers” and “shields” should be transposed as in <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 15.</p>
  <p>
    <i>of Judah three hundred thousand ... of Benjamin ... two hundred and fourscore thousand</i>] The total is 580,000. Under Asa’s successor, Jehoshaphat, the numbers are (<abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 14<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>18),
    Judah 780,000, Benjamin 380,000, making a total of 1,160,000, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    twice the total given above. The moral which the Chronicler would enforce by these figures seems to be that Judah was strong in the early days of Asa, while Asa showed faith in God, and that it became still stronger under his really religious successor, Jehoshaphat. Regarding the exaggeration of these figures, see the notes on <abbr

    <span class="smcap">Asa’s victory over Zerah:
      the Battle of Mareshah.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The present passage has much the same midrashic character as the account of Abijah’s victory related in the previous chapter, and some scholars consider that the story of the raid and defeat of Zerah has no basis in fact. It is, however, more probable that it originates in a genuine tradition of the repulse of some Egyptian, or rather Arabian (see note, verse 9), inroad, not necessarily, however, in the time of Asa: compare the Introduction § 7, <abbr
      title="page Roman Numeral 50">p. <a
      href="#a050">l.</a></abbr></p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁹And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came unto Mareshah.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>9.</b> <i>against them</i>] We should expect either <i>against him</i> (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    Asa) or <i>against Judah</i>. Perhaps this account has been torn out from some older document without regard to the context, so that the reference of <i>them</i> is lost. Compare notes on verses 12, 13, 14.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Zerah the Ethiopian</i>] Rather, <b>Zerah the Cushite</b> (“man of Cush”). Cush (Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 7)
    was the ancestor of certain Arabian tribes, including Saba, see 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 9;
    and Arabians and Cushites (“Ethiopians” Authorized Version, <a id="b226"></a>also Revised Version) are mentioned as neighbours (2 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 16).
    It is therefore highly probable that the leader of the inroad was an Arabian (Sabean) and not an Ethiopian. (Compare
    S. A. Cook in <i>Expository Times</i> June, 1906, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 541,
    against Petrie, <i>History of Egypt.</i>) <i>Zerah</i> perhaps represents <i>Dhirrīh</i> (<i>Zirrīh</i>), a title (meaning “the magnificent”) of several of the oldest princes of Saba. The tradition may therefore be brought into connection with the many indications in Chronicles of Arabian incursions on the southern borders of Judah. Mareshah, where the battle was fought (verse 9),
    was one of the ancient seats of the Calebites from which they were driven northwards (compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 2">ii.</abbr>).
    Those who prefer to regard Cushite as = Ethiopian—see 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 8—and
    Zerah as an Egyptian king, have to suppose that “Ethiopian” is applied to him loosely and somewhat ignorantly; and further, as no king of Egypt is so named, that Zerah must denote Osorkon <abbr
      title="the First">I</abbr> or <abbr
      title="the Second">II</abbr>,
    or perhaps be the name of a general of Osorkon. From <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8
    (see the note on <i>Lubim</i>) it would seem probable that the <i>Chronicler</i> believed Zerah’s host to be an Egyptian force.</p>
  <p>
    <i>a thousand thousand</i>] An inroad of the “children of the East” was formidable from sheer weight of numbers. We may gather from <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8
    that the original assailants were joined by other hordes as they drew near the border of Judah. The number <i>a thousand thousand</i> is probably meant to signify that the host was too great to number; it is, of course, not to be taken literally.</p>
  <p>
    <i>three hundred chariots</i>] The chariots, though comparatively few, are mentioned, (1) perhaps because Asa himself had <i>none</i>, (2) perhaps also because they represent an Egyptian contingent. This suggestion receives support from <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8, where the Lubim (compare <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 3)
    are associated with the Cushites in the invasion. The cowardly foreign policy of Egypt may have led her on this occasion to defend her own borders from the barbarian hordes by encouraging them to invade her neighbour’s territories.</p>
  <p>
    The reading <i>three hundred</i> is supported by the <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    and is probably right. The reading of the Peshitṭa,
    “thirty thousand,” and the wording of <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 8,
    “with exceeding many chariots and horsemen,” seem like a retouching of the narrative to make the number of the chariots and horsemen correspond with the number of the whole host.</p>

      class="txt_i">a</span>) to
    gratify the wishes of certain orthodox families in Jerusalem who counted themselves descendants of North Israelite families, especially of Ephraim and Manasseh, and were eager to think that their ancestors had associated themselves with the fortunes of the <i>true</i> Israel at an early date after the separation of the kingdoms or at least in pre-exilic days. Or (<span

    interesting suggestion first advanced by Stade and recently developed by Hölscher (<i>Palästina in der persischen und hellenistischen Zeit</i>, 1903, <abbr

    and loyal to the faith of the orthodox community in Jerusalem. The former view seems favoured by 1 Chronicles <abbr

      title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr> 25
    (despite the last words); and on general grounds the latter view seems preferable to the present writer. If so, we have in Chronicles
    the first traces of the extension of Judaism northwards from Judea into Samaria and Galilee. Hölscher thinks that the evidence of Chronicles can be supported from the late chapters Zechariah <abbr

Excavations at Ta‘anach have revealed that a goddess named <i>Ashirat</i> (= <i>Asherah</i>) was worshipped in Palestine from an early period. The references here and in the passages cited above would therefore seem to be to this goddess. That conclusion, if sound, disposes of the opinion that the Chronicler was mistaken in imagining that “Ashērah” was anything more than a common noun denoting the wooden symbol of a deity.

    only by interpreting it broadly to mean that nothing serious occurred until the war with Baasha had been going on for several years: a forced interpretation.

    Baasha was succeeded by his son Elah in the six-and-twentieth year of Asa. The number <i>thirty-six</i> may therefore be wrong.

    we should read, <b>in the five and thirtieth, that is, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa</b>. This scheme of Asa’s reign, however, agrees badly with the dominant ideas of the Chronicler, for the religious reform and covenant in the fifteenth year (verse 10)
    <i>ought</i> not to have been immediately followed by war in the sixteenth year, but rather by a period of peace and prosperity. Hence <i>thirty-six</i> may after all be the original text, and we must suppose that the Chronicler either ignored or overlooked 1 Kings <abbr

    according to the Chronicler, were evil.</p>

      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 33 = 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 43
    it is said that the high places were <i>not</i> taken away. It is remarkable that the contradiction finds an exact parallel in what is said of Asa (see <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 3 and <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 17 = 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 14).
    How can the presence of these curious contradictions be explained? It is held by some that the Chronicler in both cases has incorporated contradictory traditions, and that “such discrepancies did not trouble the Hebrew historian.” To the present writer it seems more probable to suppose that <i>only</i> <abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 3 and <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 6
    (the statements that the high places <i>were</i> removed), are from the Chronicler himself; the passages which assert the contrary, <abbr
      title="in particular">viz.</abbr> <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 17 (= 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 14) and <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 33 (= 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 43)
    being later additions. They were added by someone who, troubled by the divergence between Kings and Chronicles,
    judged it desirable to supplement or correct the Chronicler’s words by adding a more or less exact transcription of the summaries of the reigns of Asa and Jehoshaphat as recorded in Kings. If <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 17 and <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 33
    are later additions, it is evident that the Chronicler asserts the same reform to have been made in two successive reigns. But this is not a serious difficulty. He may easily have supposed that the removal of the high places (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr> the
    <a id="b237"></a>discontinuance of worship at these local sanctuaries) was but a partial success, an official rather than an actual reform; and one suspects also that the phrase for the Chronicler was largely conventional: a reform with which all “good” kings should presumably be credited.</p>

    ⁷Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, even Benhail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; ⁸and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests. ⁹And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of the <span

    <b>7<abbr title="through">‒</abbr>9.</b> These verses state that Jehoshaphat was not content with the usual reforming measures of a pious king (verse 6) but proceeded to confirm his people in loyalty to Jehovah by sending leading laymen, Levites, and priests, to teach the Law throughout the land.

      title="through">‒</abbr>9 be compared with <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    the two passages will at once be seen to be so closely similar that they may well be variations of the same tradition. Still the description in <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    is fuller and suggests arrangements of a permanent character; and, whilst <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9
    deals with <i>teachers</i> of the Law, <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    deals with administrators of it (<i>judges</i>). It is argued with force that this single or dual tradition is entirely unhistorical (so Wellhausen and Torrey). Certainly the arrangements for the judiciary and for instruction in the Law correspond with conditions <i>circa</i> 100 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>
    (see Schürer, <i>Geschichte</i>³, <abbr
      title="volume 2"><span
        class="smcap">II.</span></abbr> 176<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>179),
    conditions which probably in the Chronicler’s day were partly existent and which he may have hoped to see more fully realised. That he should wish to ascribe the institution of such a system of instruction and justice to an early date is also agreeable to his habit of thought; and for such a purpose Jehoshaphat was obviously most suitable: a good king, whose name denoted “Jehovah is judge.” Mark further the similarity of the conclusion of each reform: “And the fear of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    was on all the kingdoms of the lands ...” (<abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 10 and <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 29)
    and the remarkable prosperity which properly rewarded such pious action (<abbr

      title="and following">ff.</abbr> and <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>28).
    Yet the possibility that the Chronicler in these passages has incorporated a really old tradition associating Jehoshaphat with some reform or development of judicial affairs in Judah remains open. Some see an old trait in the conjunction of laymen (<i>princes</i>, <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 7)
    with the priests and Levites. Again the judicial system indicated in <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    has no little resemblance to that set forth in Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 18<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>20, <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 8,
    “and might have been derived from that source.” On this theory, <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 7<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>9 and <abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 4<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>11
    would in all likelihood be derived by the Chronicler from some “source” or rather perhaps from two “sources” giving slightly different accounts
    <a id="b238"></a>of Jehoshaphat’s procedure; and this is the view of some commentators (so Kittel and Benzinger). But close examination of the language of both passages reveals strong characteristics of the Chronicler’s style and spirit; and it seems safer to conclude that, while there <i>may</i> possibly have been some tradition connecting Jehoshaphat with such reforms, this account in Chronicles is essentially due to the Chronicler and reflects the situation of his own times.</p>

On the other hand the Philistines would of course be familiar from the references to them in Samuel and Kings. The tradition that tribute was received from them and from some desert tribes may possibly be correct, especially if Zerah’s army was Arabian (<abbr

If the possible proportions between the total numbers of a population and the men capable of military service at a given time be considered, it is easy to realise how monstrous an exaggeration are the figures here stated. They serve two purposes: (1) compared with the somewhat smaller numbers assigned to Abijah (<abbr
      title="chapter 13">xiii.</abbr> 3) and to Asa (<abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 8),
    they indicate that Jehoshaphat’s reign was even more prosperous; and (2) generally, they suggested to the men of the Chronicler’s own generation that in the eyes of all right-thinking men Jerusalem of old in its prosperous hours was not one whit less important and glorious than any huge and much-vaunted city of their own days.</p>

    <span class="smcap">The Prophecy of Micaiah.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    This narrative, apart from its intrinsic interest, is of great value for the welcome light it throws upon the prophets in Israel. The direct references of the later Prophets have accustomed us to the thought that <i>they</i> had to contend with unworthy representatives of their calling. Here we are made to realise with peculiar vividness that even in the early stages of the national history the false prophet was a menace to Israel’s spiritual enlightenment. Micaiah spake few words, yet he deserves to rank with the great Prophets. He resembles them at least in his overmastering conviction of the truth and in his resolution to
    <a id="b241"></a>proclaim it, whatever cost of personal suffering it may entail. His opponents were professedly servants of Jehovah, and it is noteworthy that Micaiah does not accuse them of deliberate intent to deceive Ahab but rather of self-deception and ignorance of the truth (verse 21). Their ignorance of course was blameworthy, for it was due to their willingness to prophesy smooth things: they lacked that utter integrity of heart and entire devotion to his prophetic calling which Micaiah possessed.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁴And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, at the word of the <span

    ⁵Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>

    <b>5.</b> <i>the prophets</i>] These no doubt were prophets of Jehovah (not of Baal); compare verse 4 and note on verse 6.</p>

    <b>6.</b> <i>But Jehoshaphat said</i>] The insertion of this lengthy account of an event which principally concerns the Northern Kingdom is remarkable, seeing that the Chronicler nowhere else inserts a narrative dealing with the affairs of north Israel. Some commentators find the chief motive for its insertion in this verse which credits Jehoshaphat with an honourable desire to ascertain Jehovah’s real will. A secondary motive may be that the story shows very clearly the obstinate wickedness of Ahab, as the Chronicler would regard it, and so lends point to the censure which is subsequently passed on Jehoshaphat (<abbr
      title="chapter 19">xix.</abbr> 2)
    for his alliance with the northern king.</p>

      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 7, “thou hast deceived (margin
    ‘enticed’) me,” where Jeremiah complains that he has been called to the fruitless labour of a hated prophet. For the underlying thought that delusion is sometimes a preliminary part of Divine punishment compare 2 Thessalonians <abbr

    and the famous saying, “quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat.” It should be noted however that the “lying spirit” in the mouth of the 400 prophets played only a subordinate part in Ahab’s fall, and indeed could have played no part at all, but for the fact that the king was more than willing to be enticed. Ahab had already made up his mind; he consulted the 400 only as an afterthought to satisfy Jehoshaphat (verse 4), he excluded the plain-speaking Micaiah until Jehoshaphat insisted on his presence (verses 6, 7), and he scorned the true prophet’s warning of the falseness of the 400 (verse 26).

Of course the passage is not to be regarded as a philosophical pronouncement on the origin of moral evil. Rather is it to be treated as a naïve expression regarding a great fact of human life—see the conclusion of the note on verse 19, <i>who shall entice Ahab</i>. <i>Physical</i> evils are constantly declared in the Old Testament to originate in Jehovah’s will; they are often sent by Him as punishments for sin. Here too it is only as the penalty of previous sinfulness (verse 8
    “I hate him”) that the evil moral condition of the prophets who are deluded by the lying spirit from Jehovah is imposed. A parallel may be found in Ezekiel <abbr

While the rest of the Syrian army met the Israelite attack, the chariots were to act as an independent force, whose primary task should be to kill or capture Ahab. The king of Syria felt himself overmatched and thought that the only chance of victory lay in the fall of the Israelite commander. Compare 2 Kings <abbr

      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 7
    Hanani, Jehu’s father, is mentioned rebuking Asa, Jehoshaphat’s father. The two passages, in Kings and Chronicles, are not hopelessly irreconcilable, but together they yield a very odd and improbable sequence: the son active in Baasha’s reign, the father in Asa’s, and again after some 40 years the son in Jehoshaphat’s time!</p>

    reflects the Chronicler’s view of north Israel.</p>

    “judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates.”</p>
  <p>
    In the earliest days justice was administered in Israel, as among the Bedouin of to-day, probably by all heads of families and (in difficult cases) by the one head who was distinguished above the rest for impartiality and for knowledge of tribal custom. In later days when <a id="b248"></a>Israel was settled in Canaan the “elders of the cities” and the “elders of the priests” exercised the same functions. The priests also at the great shrines, by their responses in matters brought for the decision of the Divine oracle, exercised an important part in the development and administration of law in Israel. In the monarchic period the King acted as a judge before whom difficult and important disputes seem to have been brought. His willingness to hear such cases (2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 15, <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 3 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    and his wisdom in deciding them (1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 9, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>)
    evidently affected his authority and popularity to no small extent. In the present passage it is noteworthy that the King delegates this authority even in Jerusalem.</p>
  <p>
    Jehoshaphat’s measures, as here described, are twofold, (1) to establish judges throughout the cities of Judah (compare Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 18),
    (2) to establish (in accordance with Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 8 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>)
    a kind of court of appeal in Jerusalem itself.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁸Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ <i>houses</i> of Israel, for the judgement of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>8.</b> <i>for the judgement of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,

      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    in the Pentateuch, according to the Chronicler’s belief). The second phrase (“controversies”) probably means civil disputes for which arbitration, rather than a strictly legal decision, was suitable.</p>
  <p>
    <i>And they returned to Jerusalem</i>] These words are certainly a textual mistake. Read either, <b>And they</b> (the judges appointed by Jehoshaphat) <b>dwelt in Jerusalem</b>: <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    the most difficult cases could <i>always</i> be decided in Jerusalem, because the judges were always there. Or read, <i>and for the controversies</i> <b>of the inhabitants of Jerusalem</b> (compare <abbr

    <i>before the new court</i>] The Temple of Solomon, strictly speaking, had only one court, but the Chronicler speaks of it in terms which seem more appropriate to the post-exilic Temple with its inner and outer courts (see the note on <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 9).
    The terms he uses, however, are unhappily vague and it is not quite easy to determine the precise meaning. Thus here, the word used for “court” is <i>ḥāṣēr</i>, which according to <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 9
    ought to mean the inner court, the court of the priests, as distinguished from the outer court of the people, the “<i>‘azārāh</i>.” On this view, the phrase means that Jehoshaphat was in the <i>‘azārāh</i>, standing not <i>in</i> but <i>before</i> the <i>ḥāṣēr</i> of the priests. But the inner court must be the old original court, and it seems quite impossible that the Chronicler, as he <a id="b251"></a>does here, should describe it as <i>new</i>: that adjective can be applicable only to a secondary, outer, court. We must therefore suppose that he here uses the word <i>ḥāṣēr</i> for the court he elsewhere designates by the special term <i>‘azārāh</i>.

Even if the south Arabian Minaeans were meant, it might be said that the two peoples were cognate and that Minaean invaders in passing through Mount Seir would probably bring along with them Edomite kinsmen. The region loosely denoted by Mount Seir was practically synonymous with Edom, extending from the south of the Dead Sea to the head of the Gulf of Akaba.</p>

    This saying magnificently expresses the very essence of this story of deliverance won <a id="b253"></a>by faith. And further it reveals the deepest aspect of the Chronicler’s attitude to life. It is the living heart of the whole history as he tells it. We are impatient of the mechanical and grandiose elements in his work, because the taste for such exaggeration has passed away and the necessity for laying stress on the ritual of religion has little relevance for our times. But all criticism of the books of Chronicles is superficial which fails to see that the writer is inspired by a splendid faith in God and a grand determination to maintain the religious attitude as the one ultimate key to life’s meaning. The present story is intended to assert the value of reliance upon God, in the midst of overwhelming peril still “trust in God and do the right”; and to assert this in the strongest conceivable terms. Thus it is related that the victory was gained without any need for Jehoshaphat’s <i
      lang="fr">grande armée</i>
    of 1,160,000 men! Turn from the tale to the circumstances of the post-exilic Jewish community, and the heroism of such teaching leaps to light. It is when we are surrounded by unscrupulous and powerful foes and have not 1000 soldiers, far less 1,000,000, that the reality of our trust in God and goodness is put to the test. “Aye,” says the Chronicler, “but, if like Jehoshaphat you <i>had</i> 1,000,000, it is still the supreme duty of man to rely on God.” Great teaching, and greatly followed by the enfeebled yet indomitable Jews. While they were thus helpless, Jehovah wrought for Israel, even as the Chronicler relates that He destroyed the enemies of Jehoshaphat in the wilderness of Jeruel. “The Jews stood still and saw the working out of their deliverance; great Empires wrestled together—Babylonian, Persian, Greek, and Roman—like Moab, Ammon, and Edom, in the agony of the death struggle: and over all the tumult of battle Israel heard the voice of Jehovah, ‘The battle is not yours, but God’s; ... set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the deliverance of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem’” (Bennett, <i>Chronicles</i>, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 387).
    Certainly the post-exilic Jews were so weak that trust in their own armed power was at almost all times manifestly absurd, yet this does not mean that they were thereby driven to the policy of quiet faith. There was an alternative ever before them—despair and unbelief: <i>that</i> they resolutely refused. Such were the stern realities which ought to be weighed when we seek to realise the moral and spiritual worth of the Chronicler and his doctrines.</p>

It is preferable to suppose that certain supernatural Divine agents were meant by the Chronicler.

    The Chronicler gives a somewhat different account of this incident from that in Kings. According to the latter, Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    a particular kind of vessel) to sail to Ophir for gold, and <i>refused</i> the offer of Ahaziah to cooperate in the enterprise. It is then added that the enterprise failed, as the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. The Chronicler, on the other hand, expressly asserts that Jehoshaphat “joined himself” with the wicked Ahaziah in this naval enterprise, and interprets the wreck as a Divine punishment for the sin of the alliance (the disaster being foretold by a prophet). Further he has misunderstood the term “ships of Tarshish” (see note, verse 36) and makes Tarshish, and not Ophir, the object of the voyage. The whole is said to constitute an instructive example of the freedom with which the narrative in Kings could be handled in the interests of religious teaching. The second divergence, “ships to Tarshish,” is only an error of ignorance, but the first is important. Without, however, denying that the Chronicler has been careful to point the moral of his tale, it may be urged that his version is not obtained simply by an arbitrary alteration of Kings, but rather reflects an <i>independent</i> account of the affair, perhaps more reliable than that in Kings. Almost certainly Jehoshaphat was still virtually subject to Israel, and the Chronicler’s tradition may be true to fact in representing him as partner with Ahaziah from the start of the enterprise. At least the possibility must not be ruled out because the story suited the Chronicler’s religious predilections. Again it is quite improbable that the story of the seer of Mareshah is wholly an invention of the Chronicler (see notes on verse 37).
    The passage therefore yields some evidence of access to traditions other than those in Kings; and their value deserves to be fairly considered.</p>

    points out how suitable Mareshah is as the home of a prophet antagonistic to Jehoshaphat. The town was situated in the Shephelah (see <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 8,
    note; and also Peters and Thiersch, <i>Painted Tombs in the Necropolis of Marissa</i>); and would be in close touch with the Philistine and Edomite (Arabian) districts, which were “stirred up” to revolt in the time of Jehoram, Jehoshaphat’s son. Note also the association of Mareshah in the tradition of Zerah’s invasion in Asa’s reign (<abbr
      title="chapter 14">xiv.</abbr> 10).
    It is unlikely that the Chronicler would have “invented” Mareshah as the home of Eliezer; rather is it reasonable to infer that he is utilising an old tradition, independent of Kings and at least noteworthy for its consistency.</p>

      title="and following">f.</abbr>)
    it appears that Edom was subjugated in the reign of David, and it seems to have remained so until Jehoram’s reign. If, as is probable, the <i>Meunim</i> are to be reckoned an Edomitic tribe (see the notes on <abbr
      title="chapter 20">xx.</abbr> 1, 10),
    Edom may have made a vain attempt to throw off the Judean suzerainty in Jehoshaphat’s time, and this would suit the remark in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 47
    “And there was no king in Edom: a deputy was king”—<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    a nominee of Jehoshaphat. Moreover the tradition of Jehoshaphat’s shipbuilding at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Akaba implies the maintenance of his hold over Edom.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁹Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>9.</b> <i>Then Jehoram passed over</i>] In Kings “passed over <i>to Zair</i>” (the place is not otherwise known; for a suggestion that the Moabite <i>Zoar</i> should be read, see <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> <abbr

      title="page">p.</abbr> 631 <i><abbr
      title="at the end">ad fin.</abbr></i>).
    Without the addition of a place name the verb “passed over” in Chronicles is somewhat awkward. It is possible that the Chronicler used it in the meaning that Jehoram with a vanguard of chariots <i>passed by</i> his main body of “the people” to take the lead. Although the text in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 8">viii.</abbr> 21
    appears to have suffered some corruption, it is fairly clear that Jehoram pushed on with his chariots as a vanguard, was hemmed in by the Edomites, and, though he succeeded in cutting his way out by a night attack, his main army had dispersed in the belief that the king and the chariots were cut off and lost.</p>

    (where Elisha seems already to have taken Elijah’s place). That the writing was a prophecy of Elijah denouncing Jehoram in anticipation of his reign is not only utterly improbable, but the plain words of the Chronicler do not seem even to suggest it. It is possible to suppose that some adaptation of words of Elijah to suit Jehoram’s case was placarded by an unknown hand outside Jehoram’s palace; but again the explanation seems more elaborate than the simple statement warrants. It is more probable therefore that the Chronicler means plainly a letter from Elijah, and ignores the anachronism involved in supposing the prophet to have been alive in Jehoram’s reign. So great wickedness seemed to him to require a rebuke from a well-known prophet, and it is put into the mouth of Elijah, who, as the great opponent of the idolatry of Ahab and Jezebel, seemed to be the most proper person to pronounce the denunciation. The style of the letter requires a late date, and the author is perhaps the Chronicler himself. See further the Introduction § 7, <abbr

    The Chronicler’s theory of life demanded that disasters should mark the close of this wicked reign, and in view of the licence which marks the Chronicler’s reconstruction of the history, it must be allowed that a raid by the very peoples who had paid tribute to Jehoshaphat (<abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 11)
    may be only a conjecture to suit the requirements of his religious conviction. But neither the absence of the story from Kings, nor yet the religious appropriateness of the attack entails its rejection as unhistorical. The comparative fulness and vigour of the Chronicler’s account of these reigns yields many suggestive indications (some of which have already been noted) favouring the view that he had before him valuable independent traditions of Edomite and Philistine hostilities against Judah which were referred to this period. That being so, the possible historicity of this tradition in verses 16, 17
    must be admitted; and it should be noted that such a raid would be a most natural sequel to Jehoram’s loss of control over Edom recorded in verse 8.</p>

    Ancient geographical ideas were very inexact. Herodotus regarded all the land east of the Nile as part of Arabia. Distant lands are apt to be conceived of as all more or less “beside” one another.

    The brethren (in the strict sense of the word) of Ahaziah had already been killed (verse 1).</p>
  <p>
    <i>ministering</i>] According to 2 Kings
    they were going to “salute the children of the king and the children of the queen” (probably a courtly expression for “salute the king and the queen”). Their murder in Kings is clearly regarded as subsequent to Ahaziah’s death, whereas in Chronicles the attack on Ahaziah (verse 9) apparently is placed <i>after</i> the murder of the brethren as recorded in the present verse. It is possible, however, to suppose that verses 8 and 9 are not meant to be related to each other in a time sequence, and that verses 7, 8, 9 are all relatively independent statements.</p>

    <b>9.</b> <i>now he was hiding in Samaria</i>] If Samaria means the city, then according to Chronicles
    Ahaziah fled southward from Jezreel; while according to 2 Kings
    his flight was westward to Megiddo (to be identified with Khan el-Lejjun, Bädeker, <i>Palestine</i>⁵, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 228).
    Perhaps however Samaria means the <i>province</i> (as in <abbr
      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 13; Ezekiel <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 10).
    Even so this account of Ahaziah’s wounding and death differs markedly from that in Kings, where nothing is said of his <i>hiding</i>, but simply that he went out with Joram when Jehu encountered Joram (so here verse 7), was wounded, fled to Megiddo, and died there, but was carried back by his servants to Jerusalem and there buried. Here it is stated that he was captured, brought to Jehu, and slain (?before him). The place of his burial is unnamed, but it would readily be supposed that he was buried by <i>Jehu’s</i> servants and not at Jerusalem. These divergences in verses 8, 9 are curious and are most naturally explained as originating in a variant form of the tradition.</p>

    <span class="smcap">The Conspiracy against Athaliah.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The account in Kings of the famous conspiracy which resulted in the downfall and death of Athaliah the queen mother and the coronation of the child Joash has the marks of a graphic and accurate narrative. The Chronicler evidently desired to reproduce it word for word, but in one point he was obliged to alter it in accordance with his ideas. In Kings the plot is engineered by the high-priest Jehoiada with the help of the officers (“captains of hundreds”) and men of the Carites and the guard, (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    the royal body-guard), who were foreign mercenaries. But the statement in 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 4, 11,
    that these men who were both laymen and foreigners were permitted by the high-priest to be within the court of the Temple, though no doubt correct in point of fact (see Ezekiel <abbr
      title="chapter 44">xliv.</abbr> 6 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>),
    was inconceivable to the Chronicler. In his account therefore the soldiers of the guard vanish, and the “captains of hundreds” are prominent Levites, who organise the conspiracy by gathering the Levites and chief men throughout Judah (verse 2);
    and, further, careful directions are given (verse 6)
    that none shall enter the Temple save priests and Levites “for they are holy.” The passage is an interesting example of the Chronicler’s procedure in the interests of the ecclesiastical order to which he belonged and in which he believed so firmly.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>1.</b> <i>strengthened himself</i>] Compare <abbr

    (note); the phrase does not occur in the parallel passage of Kings.</p>
  <p>
    <i>Azariah</i>, <abbr title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>] The names of course are not in Kings (see previous note). The individual names add to the naturalness of the Chronicler’s account. It is unlikely that the Levitical contemporaries of the Chronicler had any reliable traditions enabling them to say who probably were the leading Priests or Levites of Jerusalem in the time of Athaliah and Joash. Perhaps the Chronicler has simply chosen names which were suitable for Levites to bear.</p>
  <p>
    <i>captains of hundreds</i>] In 2 Kings “captains over hundreds of the Carites (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr> Cherethites)
    and of the guard.” The Chronicler takes the captains to be captains of <i>Levites</i>.</p>

    <b>4.</b> <i>This is the thing that ye shall do</i>] The arrangements as given here and in 2 Kings
    are not entirely clear owing to our ignorance regarding some of the places referred to. The Chronicler did not clearly understand the scheme in Kings, but he was not troubled thereby. He was concerned only to see that in his account the Levites replaced the soldiers of the guard and that no unlawful person entered the precincts of the Temple. According to Kings, it would appear that it was the custom on the Sabbath for two-thirds of the royal guards to be free and for one-third to be on duty at the palace. In order to avoid arousing suspicion this last third was, according to Jehoiada’s directions, to be at the palace as usual, but it was to be subdivided into thirds and so distributed as to close the various means of communication between the palace and the rest of the city. Thus Athaliah was to be held as in a trap by her own guards (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 5, 6).
    The two-thirds who were free from duty on the Sabbath were to be stationed in the Temple about the young king to guard him at his coronation.</p>
  <p>
    The arrangements are differently and no doubt less correctly stated in Chronicles
    In the first place Levitical Temple guards take the place of the royal guards; secondly, the only division of the guards recognised is a simple division into thirds; finally, the stations of the different divisions are differently given, <abbr

    one-third in the Temple, one-third in the palace, and one-third at “the gate of the foundation.”</p>

    Note that the words “gave him” are not in the Hebrew
    What then is the meaning of “put the crown ... the testimony”? It is supposed that by “the testimony” some document inscribed with laws, a charter binding king and people to live according to its precepts, is meant, and that this document was placed in the hands or on the head of Joash along with the crown. The wearing of an inscription or of a document on a solemn occasion, though strange to Western thought, is not alien from Eastern methods; compare Exodus <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr>

    but evidence of such a ceremony at the coronation of a monarch is lacking. Hence it is tempting to think that we should read as the true text of Kings “put upon him the crown <b>and the bracelets</b>”—a brilliant conjecture made by Wellhausen, which involves in Hebrew
    only the addition of one consonant to the present text, but again there is no satisfactory evidence that bracelets were put on the king at his coronation: Wellhausen relied on 2 Samuel <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 10.
    Further, it is very probable that the error (if it is one) was present in the text of Kings which lay before the Chronicler, and therefore in Chronicles “the testimony” may be the original reading.</p>

    It is interesting to see that the revolt against Athaliah in Jerusalem, like the revolution led by Jehu against her parents, Ahab and Jezebel, in the Northern Kingdom, was fostered, if not indeed caused, by religious antipathy. At least these passages are of high value in showing the hold which the worship of Jehovah had already obtained upon the loyalty of Israel. Court influences, always powerful in such small states, when cast against the worship of Jehovah, were unable for long to maintain the struggle against the national “jealousy” for Him.</p>

At the same time, to the Chronicler, the royal command to use money from the poll-tax and free-will offerings for the purpose of repairs was an infringement of the priests’ prerogatives. He therefore relieves the situation, partly by representing that the money was to be obtained by a special collection throughout the land, and also by softening the twenty-three years of inaction into “hastened it not.”</p>

The episode, which is entirely unknown apart from the present passage, is most interesting. It agrees most admirably with the Chronicler’s way of thinking; for the sin of seeking Israelite help is punished through the damage inflicted by the disappointed soldiers after their dismissal, whilst the virtue of dismissing them in obedience to the prophet’s command is rewarded by the victory gained by Amaziah over Edom. The story seems too subtle to be <i>wholly</i> an invention, and several scholars consider it probable that the hiring of the Israelites and their subsequent plundering has a basis in some old tradition.</p>

    The overwhelming defeat of Amaziah by Joash of Israel, involving the destruction of part of the defences of Jerusalem and the plundering of the Temple, must have been an affair of the highest importance in <a id="b283"></a>Judean history. The relative weakness of Judah compared with Israel is still less apparent in Chronicles than in Kings. For a discussion of the evidence see Cook in <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, <abbr

    <b>17.</b> <i>took advice</i>] <b>Took counsel</b>, presumably (according to the Chronicler’s narrative) with a view to demanding satisfaction from Joash for the ravages of the Israelite mercenaries (verse 13). The sequel suggests that Joash refused to give satisfaction.</p>
  <p>
    <i>let us look one another in the face</i>] The proposal may be either to fight or (better) to discuss Amaziah’s claims, the two kings meeting as equals. The latter is probably the right alternative, for the answer of Joash draws a scoffing parallel between Amaziah’s proposition and a thorn’s proposal of alliance with a cedar. Had Amaziah’s words been a <i>challenge to fight</i>, Joash’s answer might rather have taken the form of the parable in Judges <abbr

    Yet this is not very likely, and from the position of the present verse in Kings it would seem as though the statement in its original context should be interpreted thus: “he, <i>Amaziah</i>, built Eloth,” <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>;
    and the king referred to in the clause “after that the king slept with his fathers” is probably Jeroboam king of Israel (so Barnes on 2 Kings <abbr

    <b>5<abbr title="through">‒</abbr>10.</b> It is probable that the Chronicler had old and genuine tradition to rely on for the account which he here gives of Uzziah’s prosperity—his wars against neighbouring tribes (verses 6<abbr

    Doubtless in the earlier years of Uzziah’s reign Judah was still suffering from the effects of the defeat inflicted by Joash of Israel. But the general accuracy of the picture of the reign is assured by such facts as (1) the stout resistance offered by Jerusalem to the Assyrians in Hezekiah’s time as contrasted with its capture by the Israelites in Amaziah’s reign (<abbr

    <b>7.</b> <i>against the Philistines, and against the Arabians</i>] “Conditions in the comparatively small and half-desert land of Judah depended essentially on its relations with the Edomite and Arabian tribes on the south-east and with the Philistines on the west”: note how this comes out in the traditions of the period as narrated in Chronicles Jehoshaphat dominated both Philistines and Arabians (Edomites) (<abbr
      title="chapter 17">xvii.</abbr> 11);
    but Libnah (near Lachish) and Edom revolted successfully against his son Jehoram (<abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 10).
    After the reigns of Ahaziah and Joash, Amaziah found himself able to assail Edom and gained a great victory (<abbr
      title="chapter 25">xxv.</abbr> 11, 12).
    Later in his reign Amaziah suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Joash of Israel, and it is reasonable to suppose that Edom would seize the opportunity to reassert its independence, though Chronicles
    is silent on the point. It is therefore in harmony with the sequence of events as narrated by the Chronicler, when in the present verse (compare verse 2) we are told that Amaziah’s successor, Uzziah, reestablished the Judean power over Edom, and that later, against Ahaz, Edom and the Philistine cities gained the upper hand (<abbr

    the Syro-Ephraimite war also began in Jotham’s reign. The notices in Kings and Chronicles may be regarded as supplementary. Ammon was a natural ally of the Syrians, and perhaps the wording of verse 5 (end) hints that <i>after</i> the third year Ammon was able to refuse to pay tribute. The information of Chronicles is therefore plausible; but it is curious that Chronicles preserves the one incident and Kings the other. The point is highly significant. Not only does it illustrate very forcibly the comparative independence of the Chronicler’s narrative, which is so marked a feature in these later reigns; but also it adds to the evidence in favour of the view that the Chronicler had traditions before him other than those of Kings. Clearly he had no motive for suppressing the statement of Kings and inventing instead a war with Ammon. We must suppose that he followed some authority independent of Kings.</p>

      title="in particular">viz.</abbr>
    an Edomite and a Philistine invasion (verses 16<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>18);
    but all the incidents of the older tradition are altered and given new settings in such a way as may best serve what is plainly the Chronicler’s main object, namely by heightening the disasters to show the exceeding sinfulness of sin. For details of the changes, see the notes on verses 5<abbr

    ¹Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he did not that which was right in the eyes of the <span

    like David his father: ²but he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for the Baalim.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>1.</b> <i>Ahaz</i>] The full form of the name is <i>Jehoahaz</i>, the “Ja-u-ḥa-zi” of an inscription of Tiglath-pileser <abbr

  <p>
    <i>twenty years old</i>] As he died sixteen years later leaving a son of <i>twenty-five</i> (Hezekiah, <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 1),
    Ahaz would have been only ten years old when Hezekiah was born. The numeral here or in <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 1 must
    <a id="b293"></a>therefore be incorrect. The Peshitṭa
    in this verse reads “twenty-five years old,” which is more suitable and may be right, but the coincidence would be strange if three kings in succession ascended the throne at twenty-five years of age (compare <abbr
      title="chapter 27">xxvii.</abbr> 1 and <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 1).</p>
  <p>
    <i>he did not that which was right</i>] It is not said of Ahaz as of Manasseh, the worst of all the Judean kings, that “he did that which was evil” (<abbr
      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 2).</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ³Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>3.</b> <i>the valley of the son of Hinnom</i>] The name in Hebrew <i>Gē-ben-hinnōm</i> or <i>Gē-hinnōm</i> is more familiar in the Greek form <i>Gehenna</i> (Matthew <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 22,
    Revised Version margin). The valley was south and south-west of Jerusalem. The evil reputation of the place perhaps was due originally to some connection with the worship of Molech (Jeremiah <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 31, 32).
    Later it appears that the refuse of Jerusalem and the corpses of criminals were deposited in this valley, and as the verse Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 66">lxvi.</abbr> 24
    “they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched ...” was associated with this valley, the name <i>Gehenna</i> was eventually used to signify the place of eternal punishment (compare Mark <abbr
      title="chapter 9">ix.</abbr> 43).</p>
  <p>
    <i>burnt his children in the fire</i>] There is no doubt that actual sacrifice of the child’s life by fire is implied in this formula and in parallel phrases such as “made his son to pass through the fire” (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 3).
    Unfortunately the gruesome evidence regarding child-sacrifice among the ancients—Greeks and Romans as well as Semites—is far too strong to allow the theory that always or even generally branding or some symbolical dedication by fire was employed (see Barnes on 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 5).
    It seems that the horrible custom, which was common with the early Canaanites and Phoenicians, was very rare among the early Israelites and the kindred people of Moab (see Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 11">xi.</abbr> 31 and 39; 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 3">iii.</abbr> 27),
    and was called forth only by the pressure of extreme need. Evidently in the break-up of the national faith which attended the imminent downfall of the State of Judah the evil authority of Ahaz and Manasseh made the practice common (see <abbr
      title="chapter 33">xxxiii.</abbr> 6; 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 6; Micah <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 7; Jeremiah <abbr

      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>18
    may be regarded as a magnificent repudiation of the rite in the worship of Jehovah, and the practice is expressly forbidden in the Law, Leviticus <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 21; Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 10.</p>
  <p>
    <i>his children</i>] In Kings, “his son” (singular), a better reading. It is possible that the sacrifice was intended to avert the danger threatened by the Syro-Ephraimite alliance.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00" id="b294">
    ⁴And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>4.</b> <i>under every green tree</i>] The Hebrew word here used for “green” (<i>ra‘anān</i>) means rather “flourishing,” the reference being not so much to colour as to condition and size. Large fine trees (which are rarer in the East than in the West) are important landmarks; compare 1 Chronicles <abbr
      title="chapter 10">x.</abbr> 12; Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 6, <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 4.
    In different ways such trees acquired a sacred or semi-sacred character (Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 1, <abbr
      title="chapter 21">xxi.</abbr> 33; Judges <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 11);
    in some cases because they were associated with theophanies, in others perhaps because the flourishing state of the tree was regarded as the sign of the presence of some local deity. “No one can imagine how many voices a tree has who has not come up to it from the silence of the great desert,” G. A. Smith, <i>Historical Geography of the Holy Land</i>, <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    The Chronicler’s account of the war conveys a very different impression from the corresponding narrative in 2 Kings. In Kings an invasion by the united forces of Israel and Syria is related. Chronicles records two separate invasions, each resulting in disaster for Ahaz. In Kings the <i>failure</i> of the allies to take Jerusalem is the chief feature in the account, while in Chronicles the damage and loss inflicted on Judah takes the first place, and the magnitude of the disaster is heightened in characteristically midrashic fashion: see the notes below on verses 5, 6.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ⁵Wherefore the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away of his a great multitude of captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>5.</b> <i>the king of Syria</i>] <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr> Rezin.</p>
  <p>
    <i>smote him</i>] From 2 Kings it appears that the Syrian king, (1) helped to shut up Ahaz in Jerusalem, (2) seized the port of Elath (Eloth) on the Red Sea which had belonged to Judah. Some of the “captives” taken to Damascus were presumably brought from Elath.</p>
  <p>
    <i>carried away of his a great multitude of captives</i>] No doubt captives were taken, some probably from Elath; but the “great multitude” is midrashic exaggeration: compare the number of slain stated in verse 6.</p>
  <p>
    <i>And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel</i>] 2 Kings records but a <i>single</i> invasion, the forces of Syria and Israel being confederate. The Chronicler’s phrase implies that two separate invasions and disasters befell Ahaz—“he was <i>also</i> delivered.”</p>

    The tale of the intervention of Oded, his appeal, the response of the people and the army to the call of conscience, with the consequent outburst of pity for the unhappy captives, who are first tended and then restored to their kinsfolk in Judah, is something far better than literal history: it is the product of a moral and religious conviction worthy of high admiration. We have, in fact, in these verses a most clear instance of that inculcation of great religious principles which was the primary object of the writer of Chronicles. A modern ethical teacher, desirous of driving home the eternal verities, may clothe them in a story which has no basis whatsoever in actual events but is the pure product of the writer’s imagination. His ancient counterpart among the Jews started with a nucleus of historical events, which however he handled freely in whatever fashion might best serve to emphasise the moral or religious lesson he desired to teach.</p>
  <p>
    The deep ethical and spiritual value of this example of how to treat the fallen foe hardly requires comment—Israel must forgive, if it would be forgiven (verse 10); the captives are—not “the enemy” but—“your brethren” (verse 11); and, when conscience is at last awakened, how great is the revulsion, and how nobly do the generous qualities of human nature appear, when the captives, laden not with the chains of bondage (verse 10)
    but with clothing and with food, are restored to their homes in peace.</p>
  <p>
    It is very evident that the writer of this fine story had in mind the no less effective and beautiful narrative of Elisha’s dealing with the captured Syrian army (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 6">vi.</abbr> 21<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>23).</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    There is an important variation here between Chronicles and Kings. According to Chronicles (verse 21) Ahaz gained nothing by his tribute to the king of Assyria; according to Kings the Assyrian accepted the offering and marched against Syria, capturing Damascus and slaying Rezin. Further in Chronicles it is said that the help of Assyria was invoked, not against the kings of Syria and Israel as in 2 Kings, but against Edomites and Philistines. Some alteration was required in consequence of the insertion in Chronicles
    of the midrashic narrative of verses 8<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>15,
    according to which Ahaz was delivered from his disaster at the hands of Israel not by the king of Assyria (so Kings) but simply through the awakening of Israel’s conscience and the consequent release of the captives and the spoil. If therefore the Chronicler was to introduce the story of Ahaz’ appeal to Assyria, he could only do so by supplying new enemies for Ahaz to combat. These, however, were appropriately found in the Philistines and Edomites, regarding whom the Chronicler seems to have had various traditions (see notes on <abbr

    <b>23.</b> <i>the gods of Damascus</i>] In 2 Kings
    the statement is merely that Ahaz made a copy of an altar which he saw at Damascus, and sacrificed <a id="b299"></a>upon it. The altar at Damascus was probably the one used by Tiglath-pileser and therefore an Assyrian rather than a Damascene altar. The use of such an altar was an act of apostasy from Jehovah, for a foreign altar implied a foreign god; compare 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 5">v.</abbr> 17.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the gods ... which smote him</i>] Early passages of the Old Testament show that the Israelites for long believed the gods of other peoples to be no less real than Jehovah. Later, when the teaching of the great prophets had impressed on the people the sense of Jehovah’s supreme majesty, the alien deities, though still conceived as real Beings holding sway over the nations worshipping them, were felt to be incomparable with Jehovah, hardly deserving therefore the title of God. Still later, in certain circles, all reality whatever was denied to the gods of the heathen; they were nothing at all (compare Isaiah <abbr
      title="chapter 40">xl.</abbr><abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 48">xlviii.</abbr>,
    <i>passim</i>). Almost certainly the last opinion would be the belief of the Chronicler and of <i>most</i> orthodox Jews of his time; so that it is unnecessary to suppose that the present phrase “which smote him” is more than a convenient way of speaking. It does not indicate that the Chronicler, or even his source in Kings, believed in the existence of these gods of Damascus. On the other hand the Chronicler (and his source) does imply in this verse that <i>Ahaz</i> had a lively belief in the efficacy and reality of the gods of his foes; and therein no doubt he correctly represents the condition of thought in that period.</p>
  <p>
    <i>the gods of the kings of Syria helped them</i>] At this time the Syrians of Damascus had been conquered by the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 9),
    so that either we must suppose a confusion in the Chronicler’s mind, or else the statement needs to be corrected by reading “kings of <i>Assyria</i> (Asshur)” for “kings of <i>Syria</i> (Aram).” The reading “Syria” might be due to some writer or scribe, who lived at a time when one Empire extended from Babylon to the Mediterranean and included both Syria and Assyria. Such was the case under the Persians and under the successors of Alexander down to the time of the Maccabees. The Romans similarly failed at first to distinguish the ancient empire east of the Euphrates, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    Assyria (= Asshur), from the peoples west of the Euphrates, the Arameans, whom they mistakenly called “Syrians” (a shortened form of “Assyrians”), whose chief cities were Antioch, Hamath, and Damascus. This use of “Syrian” has passed over into English, but the more accurate designation is “Aramean”; compare Genesis <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr> 5 (Revised Version).</p>
  <p>
    <i>helped them</i>] Render “help them.”</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">
    ²⁴And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>;
    and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>24.</b> <i>cut in pieces the vessels</i>] Presumably in order to smelt them <a id="b300"></a>and put the metal to other uses; compare 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 13. According to 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 17
    Ahaz merely “cut off the borders (‘panels’ Revised Version margin)
    of the bases and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stone.” In Chronicles something more than this is intended, for “the vessels” would naturally mean such vessels as are mentioned in 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 24">xxiv.</abbr> 13.</p>
  <p>
    <i>shut up the doors</i>] The Chronicler possibly derives his statement from the difficult passage 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 18 (<i>vide</i>
    Authorized Version and Revised Version). That passage, however, speaks merely of an alteration carried out by Ahaz on one of the entrances to the Temple, but says nothing of a complete closing of the Temple; indeed it may be gathered from 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 14<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16
    that the Temple was not closed and that the daily service went on, <i>with the great change</i> that the king’s new altar was used instead of the brasen altar. The Chronicler, unwilling to suppose so horrible a desecration of the Temple as the performance of Ahaz’ idolatries within its precincts would involve, placed these rites outside the area of the Temple and expressly asserts that the Temple was closed.</p>

    This new material describes first, the reopening and cleansing of the Temple and the restoration of worship therein (<abbr

    secondly, a solemn and magnificent celebration of the Passover (<abbr
      title="chapter 30">xxx.</abbr>);
    and thirdly, a crusade against idolatrous shrines <a id="b301"></a>and images, followed by a reorganisation of the arrangements for the support of the priests and Levites—all ecclesiastical topics dear to the heart of the Chronicler. These chapters throughout are in the spirit of the Chronicler, the incidents are generally conceived after the fashion of the ideas of his period, the language bears frequent marks of his characteristic style; and altogether there is no adequate reason to suppose that these incidents are historically true, or even are derived by the Chronicler from old tradition. They are probably his own free composition. Minor considerations point to the same conclusion (see note on <abbr
      title="chapter 29">xxix.</abbr> 3
    below); and the favourable verdict which in Kings is passed upon Hezekiah may be reckoned a satisfactory motive and a sufficient source for the Chronicler’s narrative. According to Kings (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>6)
    Hezekiah “removed the high places ... and cut down the Asherah, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made.... He trusted in the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    the God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor among them that were before him”; a eulogy sufficiently glowing to warrant the assumption that Hezekiah must also have done all those other things which seemed to the Chronicler natural for so pious a monarch to do, and which accordingly are here related.</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ¹Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah the daughter of Zechariah. ²And he did that which was right in the eyes of the <span

    the reopening must be equally so. The notion, however, served the Chronicler admirably, enabling him to enhance the piety of Hezekiah by a full description of the restoration of the Temple services.</p>

    <i>sacrifices and thank offerings</i>] The phrase means simply the special type of sacrifices which were termed “thank offerings.” The fat of such offerings was burnt on the altar, the breast and right thigh were reserved for the priests, but the remainder belonged to the offerer and was used for a joyous meal (Leviticus <abbr
      title="chapter 7">vii.</abbr> 12 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).

    ³⁴But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</p>

    <b>34.</b> <i>the priests</i>] According to Leviticus <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 5 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>
    the task of flaying the sacrifice was to be performed by the offerer. Either this passage marks a later stage in the customary ritual, or perhaps this occasion was regarded by the Chronicler as exceptional because the offerings were brought on behalf of the “congregation” in general. The verse presents other difficult features. Who were the priests who had not yet sanctified themselves? What is the significance of the evident contrast between the attitude of the priests and that of the Levites, to the disadvantage of the former? It would seem that there were priests who had deliberately or slackly failed to comply with Hezekiah’s injunction (verses 4, 5) and were therefore still ritually unclean from the pollution of the previous reign. In general we infer that the Levites had either been less deeply involved in the idolatries of Ahaz or at least were more zealous than the priests for the restoration of the worship of Jehovah alone. Possibly this tradition may truly represent the historical facts; or it may be an inference derived from 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 16
    where the subservience of the high-priest Urijah to king Ahaz is mentioned (so Kittel). Less probable is the view of Benzinger that this verse has been added by the Chronicler to the midrashic source upon which he is here depending, and that it represents merely the Chronicler’s personal predilection for the Levites as distinct from the priests.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    From verse 2 it appears that this Passover took place in the first year of Hezekiah while the Northern Kingdom was still standing. The invitation to share in it at Jerusalem which Hezekiah is here (verse 1) said to have sent to north Israel is opposed to all historic probability. The Chronicler, however, was little likely to be troubled by that difficulty, even if he had observed it (see note, verse 5). Furthermore it is a plausible suggestion that the references to Ephraim, Manasseh, <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr> in verses 1, 10, 11, 18
    really reflect conditions of the Chronicler’s own circumstances, regarding which see the note on <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 9.
    It is therefore a mistake to suggest that the date may be wrong and that the Passover really took place in the sixth year of Hezekiah after the fall of Samaria on the ground that the invitation would then be more credible.</p>

  <p class="quobrk">
    It seems clear that the story of Hezekiah’s Passover has been composed by the Chronicler on the analogy of Josiah’s grand celebration of that feast (see <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 1<abbr

    which the present festival even surpasses in some respects—<abbr
      title="in particular">viz.</abbr>
    in its scope (for all Israel and strangers, whereas Josiah’s was for Judeans only) and in its duration (for two weeks, Josiah’s for one). Josiah’s Passover was famous because of the account of it in Kings. Doubtless the Chronicler felt that a celebration of that feast was incumbent upon a great reforming monarch, and he has therefore credited Hezekiah with observing it.</p>
  <p class="scripture in_00">

  <p class="quobrk">

The combined Feast was sometimes called “the Passover” and sometimes (as here) “the feast of unleavened bread”; compare Exodus <abbr

      Hezekiah’s Precautions.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The Chronicler introduces us somewhat abruptly to the Assyrian crisis. From 2 Kings we learn that Hezekiah renounced the suzerainty of Assyria (<abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 7),
    which his father Ahaz had acknowledged (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 7).
    Thereupon Sennacherib invaded Judah, and Hezekiah was obliged to acknowledge with a heavy payment of tribute his dependence on the
    <a id="b317"></a>Assyrian king (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 13<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>16).
    Sennacherib having discovered the weakness of Judah, next demanded an unconditional surrender, intending to transport the Jews to another country (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 31, 32).
    This demand Hezekiah resisted, being strengthened thereto by Isaiah. The Chronicler does not refer to the earlier invasion or to the tribute—such a humiliation of the pious and devoted king being in his belief unthinkable. That any invasion should have taken place “after these things and this faithfulness” was sufficiently astonishing, until the issue showed that the anxiety and distress were only for the greater glory of Israel’s God and for the further proof of Hezekiah’s trust in Him.</p>
  <p class="scripture">

    He was the son of Sargon (Isaiah <abbr

    father of Esar-haddon (2 Kings <abbr

    who is commonly identified with Osnappar (compare Ezra <abbr
      title="chapter 4">iv.</abbr> 10).
    Under this dynasty Assyria reached the height of its power. The empire included Babylonia (which, however, was frequently in revolt), Assyria proper, Syria as far north as Cilicia (inclusive), and (under Esar-haddon and Asshur-bani-pal) Egypt. After Asshur-bani-pal’s death (about 626 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>)
    the Assyrian power was speedily destroyed. The form <i>Sennacherib</i> is derived from the <abbr

  <p>
    At the present day there is an underground tunnel cut through the rock leading from <abbr

    down to the Lower Pool of Siloam (Bädeker, <i>Palestine</i>⁵, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 25, 83).
    It is rudely constructed and owing to its windings is 586 yards long, though the distance in a straight line is only 368 yards. As therefore the Lower Pool was probably within the ancient walls, while <abbr
      title="Saint">St</abbr> Mary’s Well
    was outside, this tunnel may be Hezekiah’s conduit. If the well were stopped, the besiegers would lose the water, which would collect in the Pool for the use of the besieged. An inscription in ancient Hebrew characters (“The Siloam Inscription”) discovered <i

    <b>12.</b> <i>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away</i>] Besides this appeal to the religious prejudices of the people, Sennacherib’s servants employed two other arguments, according to 2 Kings—(1) the paucity of Hezekiah’s soldiers (2 Kings <abbr

    and (2) possible reliance on Egyptian help (2 Kings <abbr

  <p>
    <i>his high places</i>] compare 2 Kings <abbr

    The “high places” (<i>bāmōth</i>) were properly sanctuaries of Jehovah, and not necessarily idolatrous in themselves. But since originally all, or almost all, of these <i>bāmōth</i> had been sacred places of the Canaanite gods, old idolatrous symbols (<abbr
      title="for example">e.g.</abbr>
    the <i>ashērah</i>) and old idolatrous ideas and rites persisted in the worship there offered. When finally the Jews restricted sacrificial worship to Jerusalem, the <i>odium</i> attaching to these “high places” became greater than ever, and hostility towards them came to be regarded as the mark of any pious monarch. Hezekiah removed the <i>bāmōth</i> throughout the country.</p>

    the statement could hardly emanate from the Chronicler himself but must be derived from some old and presumably trustworthy source: an unsatisfactory view. Certainly the Chronicler cannot have understood the phrase to mean anything derogatory to Hezekiah, and there is, in fact, no necessity to interpret it as some place <i>outside</i> the royal sepulchres.

  <p class="quobrk">
    It has been urged that the tradition of Manasseh’s captivity in Babylon, his restoration to the throne of Judah, and his attempt at reformation—events related only by the Chronicler—ought not to be regarded as historically true, but are simply inventions put forward as a possible explanation of the (to the Chronicler) strange fact that the wicked king Manasseh reigned for no less than fifty and five years. The objections to the tradition are not slight—in view of the general character of the Chronicler’s work. In particular, the story of Manasseh’s penitence might easily be an assumption to justify the fact of his long reign, and it is very difficult to correlate it with Jeremiah <abbr
      title="chapter 15">xv.</abbr> 4,
    where the captivity of the nation is expressly declared to be due to Manasseh’s wickedness. The evidence is not decisive, however; and a brief and perhaps half-hearted repentance towards the close of his reign might well be forgotten or deemed negligible. The evidence against the historicity of the tradition of the <i>captivity</i> of Manasseh is much less strong, being chiefly the silence of Kings. The facts mentioned in the following note indicate that there is nothing inherently improbable in the tradition, and it is therefore legitimate to accept it as very possibly correct, although we are not yet able to confirm it from the Assyrian records.</p>

    <b>11.</b> <i>Assyria</i>] Manasseh is mentioned in an Assyrian list of kings tributary to Esar-haddon and Asshur-bani-pal, but no Assyrian inscription at present known speaks of his captivity. We have, however, monumental evidence that there was a great insurrection against Asshur-bani-pal, the grandson of Sennacherib, in which Western Asia (and <i>perhaps</i> Manasseh) was involved. The subsequent restoration of Manasseh to his kingdom is not incredible, for Neco I of Egypt was first put in fetters and afterwards sent back to Egypt.

The “prayer” referred to by the Chronicler is quite certainly not to be associated even remotely with this apocryphal work, which by some is thought to have been written originally in Greek, though it has also been regarded as a Greek translation from some Hebrew midrashic source. Its date is uncertain. It is given in a collection of hymns appended to the Psalter in the Alexandrine <abbr

  <p class="quobrk">
    Of Josiah only good is recorded in Kings: “he did that which was right in the eyes of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>,
    and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left” (2 Kings
    <a id="b330"></a><abbr title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 2). In the eighteenth year of his reign he is said to have ordered a repair of the Temple in the course of which a discovery was made of a book of the Law. In consequence of its injunctions a thorough reformation was carried out by Josiah, a solemn covenant with God being entered into by the king and all the people, and attested first by a crusade against all idolatrous images and symbols throughout the land and then by a grand celebration of the Passover feast (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr><abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 27).
    Obviously Josiah was a king after the Chronicler’s own heart. He makes Josiah’s reforming energy begin as early as his eighth year, causing some changes in the order of events (see the note on verse 3).
    On the record of the Passover feast the Chronicler has naturally fastened with special pleasure, and he expands the brief allusions to it in Kings into a detailed account occupying <abbr
      title="chapter 35">xxxv.</abbr> 1<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>19.
    His narrative of the death of Josiah differs considerably from that in Kings. Several other minor variations are pointed out in the notes below.</p>

    ³For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the graven images, and the molten images.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    <b>3.</b> <i>in the eighth year ... and in the twelfth</i>] It should be noticed that the order of the events of Josiah’s reign given in Chronicles varies from that given in 2 Kings Thus we have in 2 Chronicles:</p>
  <p>
    (1) Destruction of idolatrous symbols throughout Jerusalem, Judah and Israel; <abbr
      title="chapter 34">xxxiv.</abbr> 3<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>7.</p>

  <p>
    In 2 Kings on the other hand (2) and (3) precede (1), and the reforming activity of the king is accordingly placed subsequent to the finding of the Law in the eighteenth year of his reign. There can be little doubt that the order in Kings is correct. The Chronicler thought it desirable that the piety of the king should be displayed earlier, and he has therefore dated its commencement from the eighth and twelfth years. [This <a id="b331"></a>is preferable to the suggestion that “eighth” (<i>bishĕmōneh</i>) and “twelfth” (<i>bishtēym ‘esreh</i>) may be due to a transcriptional error of “eighteenth” (<i>bishĕmōneh ‘esreh</i>).]</p>
  <p>
    <i>while he was yet young</i>] There is no clause corresponding to this in 2 Kings, and the statement is probably due to the motive indicated in the previous note. There is, of course, no reason to question the piety of Josiah in his early years, for though in 2 Kings
    his reformation is dated in the eighteenth year of his reign, <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    when he was 25 years of age (hardly “young” for a king), the favourable judgement passed on him (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 2)
    is unqualified by any suggestion that he was tardy in turning to Jehovah, and the prophetic activity of Jeremiah is dated from the thirteenth year of Josiah’s reign (Jeremiah <abbr

    and to clothes in general; it is therefore not easy to say what office precisely is here referred to. Perhaps the garments here meant were ecclesiastical and not royal.

    <b>28.</b> <i>thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace</i>] So also in 2 Kings But in point of fact Josiah met with a violent death, being slain by Neco, king of Egypt, according both to Kings (2 Kings <abbr

    From the contradiction between this prediction and the event, we may infer that in the prophecy of Huldah we have an old and reliable tradition, which obviously must have been made before the death of Josiah. That the contradiction was allowed to stand in Kings is not perhaps surprising, but it is remarkable in the Chronicler’s narrative. Not only does the idea of a genuine prophecy failing to come true run counter to his fixed principles, but (judging from many definite instances as well as from the whole tone of his history) the tradition that a king so pious from the start to the finish of his reign should meet his death in a disastrous battle must have seemed to him well-nigh incredible. The fact remains that he <i>has</i> allowed the tradition to stand, but it is certainly surprising.</p>

    <i>Hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span></i>]
    This remarkable statement has proved to be a fruitful subject of discussion. What precisely is meant by “the book of the law” said to have been found by Hilkiah in the Temple? It is essential to distinguish between the answer which the Chronicler would have given to this question and the conclusions reached by an independent survey of the problem. (1) Undoubtedly the Chronicler supposed “the book of the law” to be the whole Pentateuch, since he believed that the entire Law existed as it now is from the time of Moses. The argument against his view is obvious to us at the present time. Beside the practical objection of the impossibility of reading the whole Pentateuchal Law twice in succession to different persons on the same day (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 8, 10)—a
    difficulty which perhaps the Chronicler himself perceived and sought to avoid, see note on verse 18,—there is the overwhelming testimony of the general evidence that a large part of the Pentateuch <i>in its final
    <a id="b338"></a>form</i>, with which the Chronicler was familiar, is of post-exilic date. <i>His</i> Pentateuch was quite certainly not “the book” found by Hilkiah. (2) It is extremely interesting to observe that the first step towards the judgement of modern criticism was taken at a very early date and by certain of the Christian Fathers—Jerome, Procopius of Gaza, Chrysostom—who put forward the view that the book in question was not the whole Pentateuch but only the Book of Deuteronomy. [For the details the student must be referred to articles in the <i>Zeitschrift für alttestamentliche Wissenschaft</i>, 1902, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 170 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>, 312 <abbr
      title="and following">f.</abbr>,
    and the <i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i>, 1903, <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 50.]
    This view, first developed scientifically by De Wette, gained eventually a very wide acceptance amongst scholars. Stress is laid upon the resemblance between the reforms ascribed to Josiah and the exhortations and injunctions of Deuteronomy, particularly as regards the restriction of sacrificial worship to one sanctuary (<abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr> Jerusalem; compare Deuteronomy <abbr
      title="chapter 12">xii.</abbr> 10<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>14).
    For the evidence the student may consult Chapman, <i>Introduction to the Pentateuch</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 135<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>146, especially <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 142<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>145
    (in this series); or Driver, <i>Deuteronomy</i> (International Critical Commentaries), <abbr
      title="pages Roman Numeral 44">pp. xliv</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    (3) Further, internal consideration of the Book of Deuteronomy has led to the conclusion that it cannot all date from the time of Josiah: and thus it is now generally held that Hilkiah’s “book of the law” was not the final form of Deuteronomy, but only the <i>nucleus</i> of that Book—probably chapters <abbr
      title="5 through 26">v.‒xxvi.</abbr> and <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr>, or <abbr
      title="chapters 12 through 26">xii.‒xxvi.</abbr> and <abbr
      title="chapter 28">xxviii.</abbr>,
    or even certain passages from those chapters (see Chapman, <i>Introduction to the Pentateuch</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 144, 145;
    or Driver, <i>Deuteronomy</i>, <abbr
      title="pages Roman Numeral 65">pp. lxv</abbr> <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>).
    (4) Finally, there are grounds for doubting whether any part of Deuteronomy can be dated from the time of Josiah. It is suggested that the Deuteronomic code is not earlier than Jeremiah but later. Although this view does not yet command general acceptance, it is fair to insist that it rests upon evidence which cannot be so lightly set aside as is occasionally supposed. The student may conveniently refer to remarks by R. H. Kennett in the <i>Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics</i>, <abbr
      title="volume 7">vol. <span
        class="smcap_all">VII.</span></abbr>, <abbr
      title="under the word">s.v.</abbr> <i>Israel</i> <abbr
      title="page">p.</abbr> 447,
    and to the references there given, especially
    the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>, <abbr
      title="volume 7"><span
        class="smcap">VII.</span></abbr> [1906], <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 481 <abbr
      title="and following">ff.</abbr>
    If Deuteronomy be later than the time of Josiah, what then can we suppose this “book of the law” (<i>sēpher hattōrah</i>) to have been; for there is no reason to question the accuracy of the tradition that some impressive writing was discovered in the Temple? The answer will be—in all probability—some scroll of prophetic teaching, in which the abuses of worship (perhaps in Manasseh’s reign) and in particular the corruptions of the country “high places” were searchingly denounced and an appeal made for reform. Since at that date the term <i>tōrah</i> was applicable to prophetic teaching as well as to legal instruction, such a work would be known as “a book of <i>tōrah</i>.” It is not a very serious objection that the text here and in Kings reads “the book of the law (<i>hattōrah</i>),” partly because a peculiarity of Hebrew grammar would still allow the translation “a book of <i>tōrah</i>,” partly because the introduction of the definite article into the text would be most natural, so soon as it came to be thought that the phrase referred to Deuteronomy or the Pentateuch. We may summarise as follows:—To
    <a id="b339"></a>the Chronicler “the book of the law” signified the whole Pentateuch in its final form; to the compilers or editors of Kings (the Chronicler’s <i>source</i>), who probably wrote at the “Deuteronomic” stage of the history, it no doubt meant Deuteronomy; and lastly, according to modern judgement the book actually discovered was either the earliest or essential portions of Deuteronomy or possibly a pre-Deuteronomic prophetic writing demanding the purification of worship in Jerusalem and urging the abolition of the sacrifices and feasts at the local shrines.</p>

      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    in Jerusalem.” Actually the novelty of Josiah’s festival was (<abbr
      title="1">i</abbr>) that
    it was kept <i>in Jerusalem</i>, whereas previously the Passover had been a household feast observed at any “high-place” throughout the country, and (<abbr
      title="2">ii</abbr>) that
    it thus marked the inauguration of the system of only one legitimate sanctuary—Jerusalem—which was codified in Deuteronomy. The writer in Kings may have clearly understood that the point lay in the words “in Jerusalem.” To the Chronicler, the statement meant merely an assertion that this feast was the <i>grandest</i> Passover since the days of the judges (he prefers to write <i>since Samuel</i>, reckoning him the last of the judges).</p>

    <b>19.</b> <i>In the eighteenth year</i>] Comparison of the later Greek version (the so-called <abbr

    of this verse with the earlier Greek version (the <i>old</i> <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>)
    preserved in 1 Esdras reveals that this passage is one of great interest for the history of the text. After verse 19
    “In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept,” 1 Esdras <abbr
      title="chapter 1">i.</abbr> 23, 24
    has a remarkable addition as follows: “And the works of Josias were upright before his <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    with a heart full of godliness. Moreover the things that came to pass in his days [or ‘the things concerning him’] have been written in times past concerning ... those that sinned and did wickedly
    <a id="b343"></a>against the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> above every people and kingdom, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the <span
      class="smcap">Lord</span>
    were confirmed against Israel.” Then follows verse 25 (compare Hebrew verse 20) “Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass that Pharaoh, king of Egypt,” <abbr
      title="et cetera">etc.</abbr>
    Probably some words have been lost at the point where the dots are placed. As it stands, the passage <i>seems</i> to associate the reign of the godly Josiah with wicked and irreligious doings. The inference to be drawn is that this passage was originally part of the Hebrew text (from which the old <abbr
      title="Septuagint">LXX.</abbr>
    was translated), but was subsequently excised on account of its apparent aspersion on the character of Josiah. The gap thus created was filled in some Hebrew <abbr
      title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>
    by the insertion of 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 24<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>27, and from such a Hebrew
    text the later Greek version (the present <abbr

      title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr>,
    however, the gap was left unfilled, and from one of these was derived the Hebrew text which has reached us (see Torrey, <i>Ezra Studies</i>, <abbr
      title="pages">pp.</abbr> 87<abbr

    It is only by the use of the Greek versions that we are now able to perceive that an omission has been made.</p>

    <span class="smcap">The Death of Josiah.</span></p>
  <p class="quobrk">
    The account of Josiah’s death is very much fuller in Chronicles
    than in Kings. The features which are peculiar to the Chronicler are, (1) Neco’s message to dissuade Josiah from war, (2) Josiah’s disguising himself and coming to fight <i>in the valley of Megiddo</i>, (3) the wounding of Josiah by archers, (4) the transfer of the wounded king from a war chariot to another chariot. Thus all the details which represent the meeting at Megiddo as a battle are peculiar to Chronicles.</p>
  <p>
    The account given in Kings is simply:—“King Josiah <i>went to meet</i> him (Neco), and he put him to death <i>at Megiddo</i> when he saw him. And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem.” The Hebrew expression for “went to meet” in this passage is the same as in 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 16; 2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 16">xvi.</abbr> 10;
    it does not suggest a <i>hostile</i> meeting, though it can be used in a suitable context to describe one. The phrase “when he saw him” suggests an interview rather than a battle. Thus we have two versions of Josiah’s death: according to Chronicles
    he was mortally wounded in battle, according to Kings he sought an interview with Neco and was assassinated by him at the town of Megiddo.</p>
  <p>
    These differences may be due to two distinct traditions, but it seems more probable that the Chronicler’s account is an intentional adaptation of the Kings narrative to suit the main principles of his work. We can easily realise that the bald fact of Josiah’s death at the hands of Neco presented a distressing moral perplexity to the Chronicler’s mind. Why, when Josiah had been so diligent in the service of his God, did Jehovah abandon him to death in this fashion? The stress of the problem is reflected in the rather pathetic phrase of verse 20, “After <i>all</i> this ... came Neco.” The same words are used of Hezekiah (<abbr
      title="chapter 32">xxxii.</abbr> 1),
    <a id="b344"></a>“After these things and this faithfulness, Sennacherib came ...,” but in his case the sore trial of faith proved to be for the greater glory of the God of Israel. Here the plea of a successful issue to the trouble was not available, and no doubt the story of Josiah’s end was too famous to be passed over in silence. It would seem as if the Chronicler therefore adapted the narrative so as to make it appear that Josiah made an attack on Neco in defiance of a Divine warning (verse 21), and thus deserved his fate. The somewhat similar tale of Ahab’s death (<abbr
      title="chapter 18">xviii.</abbr> 28<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>34 = 1 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 22">xxii.</abbr> 29<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>37)
    was in the Chronicler’s mind, and he appears to have drawn upon it for certain details introduced into his version of Josiah’s end (see verses 22, 23).</p>
  <p class="scripture">
    ²⁰After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</p>
  <p class="quobrk">

    According to Herodotus (<abbr
      title="Book 2"><span
        class="smcap_all">II.</span></abbr> 159)
    he conquered the “Syrians” at “Magdolus,” and then captured Cadytis (Kadesh on the Orontes, <i>or</i> Gaza?), an important city of Syria. Herodotus no doubt refers to the same great campaign of Neco which is recorded in Kings and Chronicles, though it is not at all likely that the victory over the <i>Syrians</i> at <i>Magdolus</i> is to be identified with the encounter of Neco and Josiah at Megiddo. The account of Herodotus is obscure, ambiguous, and defective, but a comparison of 2 Kings with an inscription of Nabu-na’id king of Babylon (555<abbr
      title="through">‒</abbr>538 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>)
    sets Neco’s action in a clearer light. The campaign (which took place about 608 <span
      class="smcap_all">B.C.</span>)
    was directed “against the king of Assyria” (2 Kings <abbr
      title="chapter 23">xxiii.</abbr> 29), <abbr
      title="that is">i.e.</abbr>
    against the last king Sin-šariškun (Saracos) who was at war with Nabopolassar (father of Nebuchadrezzar), king of Babylon. Nabopolassar, hard pressed, called in to his help the Umman-manda (Scythians), who destroyed Nineveh <i>circa</i> 607 <span

    Neco advanced to the Euphrates to secure some of the spoils of the Assyrian overthrow, but the crushing victory of Nebuchadrezzar over Neco at Carchemish (<i>circa</i> 605 <span

It is interesting to note that to avoid closing the book of Isaiah with the terrible verse (<abbr
